To comply with financial regulations, HIFI enforces **KYC (Know Your Customer)** and **KYB (Know Your Business)** checks before a User can receive funds from fiat (onramps) or pay out to fiat (offramps).

## KYC Requirements

Before submitting KYC information, call the KYC Requirements endpoint to see what documents and information are needed for a specific user.

## Submit KYC

Once you've gathered and uploaded the required information for the User, submit it using the [KYC Submit](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/kyc/submit-kyc) endpoint.

**What happens next:**

- **Successful submission**: Status progresses to `pending` and enters compliance review
- **Unsuccessful submission**: Status moves to `incomplete` with details about what's missing or invalid

## Track KYC Status

After you submit KYC data, use the [KYC Status](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/kyc/retrieve-kyc-status) endpoint to monitor review progress and see any follow-up actions.
When the status reaches `active`, the user can now access fiat payment functionalities.

This guide lists every possible status, explains review results, and shows complete response examples.
