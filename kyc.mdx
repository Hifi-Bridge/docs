## KYC & Rails

A Rail is a payment corridor that enables payins or payouts to specific regions. Each rail has different KYC requirements depending on what it enables.

| Rail                | Access                                                | Notes                                        |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| USD Rail            | Payins and payouts to the US via ACH, Wire, or RTP    | Full USD coverage, includes virtual accounts |
| Global Network Rail | Payouts to select corridors in Asia and Africa        | Multi-currency support across key markets    |
| Africa Rail         | Payins and payouts across supported African countries | Local currency settlement                    |

## Submit KYC

Once you've gathered and uploaded the required information for the User, submit it using the [KYC Submit](https://docs.hifi.com/api-reference/kyc/submit-kyc) endpoint.

**What happens next:**

- **Successful submission**: Status progresses to `pending` and enters compliance review
- **Unsuccessful submission**: Status moves to `incomplete` with details about what's missing or invalid

## Track KYC Status

After you submit KYC data, use the [KYC Status](https://docs.hifi.com/api-reference/kyc/retrieve-kyc-status) endpoint to monitor review progress and see any follow-up actions.
When the status reaches `active`, the user can now access the functionalities of that rail.

This guide lists every possible status, explains review results, and shows complete response examples.

## Alternative: KYC Link

If you don't want to handle KYC submission via API, generate a KYC link for users to complete verification through a web interface.
