## Getting access

Request access at [dashboard.hifi.com/request-access](https://dashboard.hifibridge.com/request-access). Our team will review and approve your account.

## Roles and permissions

<Info>
  Users are always granted admin access in the **sandbox** environment,
  regardless of their role in production.

### Admin

Complete access to all features and settings. Admins can create users, manage wallets and transactions, configure API keys, assign team roles, access financial reports, set up approval workflows, update business settings, and view billing.

### Member

Operational access with approval requirements for sensitive actions. Members can manage users and accounts but need approval for transfers. They cannot update business settings or view billing information.

### Analyst

Read-only access for monitoring and reporting. Analysts can view all business and user data but cannot create or modify anything.

## Assigning roles

Navigate to **Developer** → **Team**, select a team member, choose their role, and save. Changes take effect immediately.
