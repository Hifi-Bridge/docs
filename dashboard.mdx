## Getting access

Request access at [dashboard.hifibridge.com/request-access](https://dashboard.hifibridge.com/request-access). Our team will review and approve your account.

## What you can do

**Manage users and compliance**
Create individual or business accounts, handle KYC verification, and search users with advanced filters.

**Monitor wallets and balances**
Track real-time balances across Ethereum, Solana, Base, and other supported networks. View complete transaction history and audit trails for all wallet activity.

**Execute transactions**
Create onramps from fiat to stablecoins, set up virtual accounts for deposits, execute offramps to fiat, swap between stablecoins, and bridge assets across networks. Review and approve transactions before they execute.

**Control API access**
Generate API keys with granular permissions, rotate credentials, and manage security settings.

**Organize your team**
Assign role-based permissions to control who can view data, execute transactions, or modify settings.

## Roles and permissions

Control access through three permission levels. Each role determines what team members can view and modify.

### Admin

Complete access to all features and settings. Admins can create users, manage wallets and transactions, configure API keys, assign team roles, access financial reports, set up approval workflows, update business settings, and view billing.

### Member

Operational access with approval requirements for sensitive actions. Members can manage users and accounts but need approval for transfers. They cannot update business settings or view billing information.

### Analyst

Read-only access for monitoring and reporting. Analysts can view all business and user data but cannot create or modify anything.

## Assigning roles

Navigate to **Developer** → **Team**, select a team member, choose their role, and save. Changes take effect immediately.
