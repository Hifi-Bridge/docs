# Send a batch transfer

Learn how to distribute funds to multiple wallets in a single transaction using HIFI's batch transfer API.

## Overview

Batch transfers allow you to send funds to multiple recipients in one atomic transaction. This is ideal for:

- Payroll processing
- Mass payouts
- Airdrops and distributions
- Bulk payments

## Prerequisites

- API credentials configured
- Source wallet with sufficient balance
- List of destination wallets and amounts

## Basic batch transfer

```javascript
const batchTransfer = await hifi.transfers.createBatch({
  from: "wallet_123",
  transfers: [
    {
      to: "wallet_456",
      amount: "100.00",
      currency: "USDC",
    },
    {
      to: "wallet_789",
      amount: "250.00",
      currency: "USDC",
    },
    {
      to: "wallet_abc",
      amount: "75.00",
      currency: "USDC",
    },
  ],
  network: "ethereum",
});
```

## Advanced batch transfer

```javascript
const batchTransfer = await hifi.transfers.createBatch({
  from: "wallet_123",
  transfers: [
    {
      to: "wallet_456",
      amount: "100.00",
      currency: "USDC",
      memo: "Salary payment",
      metadata: { employee_id: "EMP001" },
    },
    {
      to: "wallet_789",
      amount: "250.00",
      currency: "USDC",
      memo: "Bonus payment",
      metadata: { employee_id: "EMP002" },
    },
  ],
  network: "ethereum",
  memo: "Monthly payroll - January 2024",
  metadata: {
    batch_id: "PAYROLL_2024_01",
    department: "engineering",
  },
});
```

## Response

```json
{
  "id": "batch_xyz789",
  "status": "pending",
  "from": "wallet_123",
  "transfers": [
    {
      "id": "transfer_abc123",
      "to": "wallet_456",
      "amount": "100.00",
      "currency": "USDC",
      "status": "pending"
    },
    {
      "id": "transfer_def456",
      "to": "wallet_789",
      "amount": "250.00",
      "currency": "USDC",
      "status": "pending"
    }
  ],
  "total_amount": "350.00",
  "currency": "USDC",
  "network": "ethereum",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Batch limits

- Maximum 100 transfers per batch
- Total amount must not exceed wallet balance
- All transfers must use the same currency and network
- Individual transfer amounts must be positive

## Error handling

Common batch transfer errors:

- **Insufficient funds**: Ensure wallet has enough balance for all transfers
- **Invalid recipients**: Verify all destination wallets exist
- **Batch too large**: Split into smaller batches if needed
- **Partial failures**: Some transfers may succeed while others fail

## Monitoring progress

```javascript
// Check batch status
const status = await hifi.transfers.getBatch("batch_xyz789");

// Check individual transfer status
const transfer = await hifi.transfers.get("transfer_abc123");
```
