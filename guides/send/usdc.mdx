# Send a wallet transfer

Learn how to send funds between wallets using HIFI's transfer API.

## Overview

Wallet transfers allow you to move funds between wallets owned by the same or different users. This is useful for:

- Peer-to-peer payments
- Treasury management
- Internal balance movements
- Cross-user transfers

## Prerequisites

- API credentials configured
- Source wallet with sufficient balance
- Destination wallet address

## Basic transfer

```javascript
const transfer = await hifi.transfers.create({
  from: "wallet_123",
  to: "wallet_456",
  amount: "100.00",
  currency: "USDC",
  network: "ethereum",
});
```

## Advanced options

```javascript
const transfer = await hifi.transfers.create({
  from: "wallet_123",
  to: "wallet_456",
  amount: "100.00",
  currency: "USDC",
  network: "ethereum",
  memo: "Payment for services",
  metadata: {
    invoice_id: "INV-001",
    category: "services",
  },
});
```

## Response

```json
{
  "id": "transfer_abc123",
  "status": "pending",
  "from": "wallet_123",
  "to": "wallet_456",
  "amount": "100.00",
  "currency": "USDC",
  "network": "ethereum",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Error handling

Common errors and how to handle them:

- **Insufficient funds**: Check wallet balance before transfer
- **Invalid wallet**: Verify destination wallet exists
- **Network issues**: Retry with exponential backoff
- **Rate limits**: Implement proper rate limiting
