title: "Global Transfers"
---

Enable businesses to send money internationally through stablecoins with instant settlement. Leverage HIFI's global network to reach recipients in multiple countries with low fees and transparent exchange rates.

**⏱️ Time to complete:** 35-45 minutes

**🎯 What you'll build:** A complete cross-border payment flow where a US business pays a Hong Kong supplier, converting USD → USDC → HKD with instant settlement and competitive rates.

## Use Case Overview

This recipe demonstrates an international B2B payment where:

- ✅ US business deposits USD from their bank account
- ✅ USD automatically converts to USDC stablecoin
- ✅ USDC transfers instantly across borders
- ✅ HKD is deposited to supplier's Hong Kong bank account

This flow enables fast, cost-effective international business payments with transparent pricing and instant settlement.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **API keys** from the Dashboard ([Get API keys](/docs/api/authentication))
- **A tool for making API calls** (cURL, Postman, or similar)
- **Basic understanding of REST APIs**
- **Your sandbox endpoint:** `https://sandbox.hifibridge.com`

<Note>
  All examples in this guide use the sandbox environment. When you're ready for
  production, simply replace the sandbox URL with the production endpoint and
  use your production API keys.
</Note>

---

## What you'll build

Here's what we'll accomplish in this recipe:

1. **Generate API Keys** - Set up authentication for HIFI API
2. **Create Business A (Payer)** - Onboard US business and complete KYB for USD rail
3. **Add Virtual Account** - Set up account for USD deposits that convert to USDC
4. **Create Business B (Payee)** - Onboard Hong Kong supplier (or use existing business)
5. **Execute Payment** - Send USDC from Business A → HKD to Business B's bank account

**Payment Flow:**

```
USD → Business A Bank Account → USDC → Business A Wallet → HKD → Business B Bank Account
```

---

## Generate API Keys

Access to the HIFI API requires authentication via API keys. Generate your keys from the HIFI Dashboard before making any API calls.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Get Your API Keys">

**Steps:**

1. Navigate to [dashboard.hifibridge.com](https://dashboard.hifibridge.com/)
2. Log in to your account
3. Go to **Developer → API Keys**
4. Click **Generate New Key**
5. Select your environment: **Sandbox** (for testing) or **Production** (for live transactions)
6. Copy the key immediately - it's only shown once

**Important Security Notes:**

- Store your API key securely (environment variables, secrets manager, etc.)
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Your key authenticates all HIFI API requests
- If compromised, immediately revoke in the Dashboard and generate a new one

<Warning>
  **API keys are shown only once.** If you lose your key, you must revoke it and
  generate a new one. There is no way to retrieve a lost key.
</Warning>

**Using Your API Key:**

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of all API requests:

```bash
--header 'authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

For a complete guide on API authentication, see our [Authentication Documentation](/docs/api/authentication).

  </Accordion>

## Create Business A (US Payer)

The paying business needs a verified business account to access fiat rails and send international payments. Every business must accept HIFI's Terms of Service and complete KYB (Know Your Business) verification before they can move money between fiat and crypto.

<Note>
  **Complete Business Onboarding Guide:** For a comprehensive walkthrough of
  business onboarding and KYB verification, see our [Business User
  Guide](/docs/users).
</Note>

### Business Creation Flow

Creating a business user involves four steps:

1. **Generate Terms of Service Link** - Get acceptance link for your business
2. **Create Business User** - Create the business account after TOS acceptance
3. **Update KYB Information** - Provide required business details and UBO information
4. **Submit KYB** - Submit for verification to unlock USD rail

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Generate Terms of Service Link">

Before creating a business user, they must accept HIFI's Terms of Service. Generate a unique acceptance link using the [Generate Terms of Service Link](https://docs.hifibridge.com/v2/reference/post_v2-tos-link) endpoint.

**Request:**

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/tos-link \
  --header 'accept: application/json' \
  --header 'authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '
{
  "idempotencyKey": "96bc39ba-c6c6-412a-9452-e95a35d3f533"
}
'
```

**Request Fields:**

<ResponseField name="idempotencyKey" type="string" required>
  A unique UUID that becomes your `signedAgreementId` after the business accepts
  the terms. Generate this using any [UUID
  generator](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="templateId" type="string">
  Optional template ID for custom Terms of Service templates.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="redirectUrl" type="string">
  Optional URL to redirect users after they accept the terms.
</ResponseField>

**Response:**

```json
{
  "url": "https://dashboard.hifibridge.com/accept-terms-of-service?sessionToken=a29d65a3...",
  "signedAgreementId": "96bc39ba-c6c6-412a-9452-e95a35d3f533"
}
```

**Response Fields:**

<ResponseField name="url" type="string">
  The unique link where the business will review and accept HIFI's Terms of
  Service.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="signedAgreementId" type="string">
  The agreement ID (same as your `idempotencyKey`). **Save this** - you'll need
  it to create the business user in the next step.
</ResponseField>

**What to do with this response:**

1. **Direct the business to the `url`** - Send this link via email or embed in your application
2. **Save the `signedAgreementId`** - You'll need this to create the business user
3. **Wait for acceptance** - The `signedAgreementId` becomes valid only after they click "Accept"

<Info>
  **Real-time Notifications:** HIFI triggers the `TOS_LINK.UPDATE` webhook event
  when the business accepts the terms, allowing you to proceed with user
  creation immediately. [Learn about webhooks →](/docs/webhooks)
</Info>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Create Business User">

Once the business has accepted the Terms of Service, create the business user account with the [Create User](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/user/create-a-user) endpoint.

  (KYC) and business (KYB) verification. For businesses, you'll provide company
  details, tax information, and Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) documentation.
</Note>

**Request:**

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/users/94dcd5c2-4508-593d-9302-fd7a5444eb20/kyc \

  the [Business User Guide](/docs/users) for detailed document requirements. In
  sandbox, KYB may be automatically approved with minimal documentation.
</Note>

<Note>
  **UBO Document Upload:** UBO (Ultimate Beneficial Owner) details are handled via a 
  separate **Add a UBO** endpoint. After you create a UBO, save the uboId from the response 
  and use it when calling the **Add Documents** endpoint so the files are attached to that specific UBO.

## Create Business B (HK Payee)

The recipient business (Business B in Hong Kong) needs a business account with an HKD bank account to receive the payment. Follow the same business creation flow as Business A, but complete KYB for the appropriate Hong Kong rail.

<Note>
  **Using an Existing Business:** If Business B already exists in your system,
  you can skip business creation and just ensure they have an active Hong Kong
  bank account. You'll need their `userId` and `accountId` for the payment
  transaction.
</Note>

### Required Information

To complete this recipe, you'll need:

- **Business B's `userId`** - From creating their business account
- **Business B's HKD `accountId`** - From adding their Hong Kong bank account

For the complete flow of creating Business B and adding their HKD bank account, follow the same steps as Business A but:

1. Use Hong Kong business information and address details
2. Submit KYB for the Hong Kong rail
3. Add an **Offramp Account** (Hong Kong bank account) instead of a Virtual Account

For detailed instructions on adding offramp accounts for international recipients, see our [Offramp Guide](/docs/transfers/offramps).

## Execute Payment

Now you can send the international payment from Business A (US) to Business B (Hong Kong). Create an **offramp** transaction that converts USDC to HKD and sends it to Business B's Hong Kong bank account.

This is a two-step process:

1. **Create offramp request** - Get a quote for the conversion
2. **Accept the quote** - Execute the payment

<Note>
  **Complete Offramp Guide:** For more details on offramps and cross-border
  transfers, see our [Offramp Transfer Guide](/docs/transfers/offramps).

**Understanding the Quote:**

In this example:

- After fees (tax: 0.170 USDC, rail: 0.100 USDC), **9.73 USDC** is converted
- At a rate of **7.56 HKD per USDC**
- Business B receives **75.63 HKD** in their Hong Kong bank account

<Warning>
  **Quote Expiration:** Quotes typically expire after 15-30 minutes to protect
  against exchange rate volatility. If your quote expires before acceptance,
  create a new offramp request for a fresh quote with updated rates.
</Warning>

✅ **Quote accepted! Cross-border payment is processing.**

The status has changed from `OPEN_QUOTE` to `CRYPTO_INITIATED`, meaning the transaction is now being executed.

**Cross-Border Payment Status Progression:**

1. `OPEN_QUOTE` - Quote generated, waiting for acceptance
2. `CRYPTO_INITIATED` - Processing crypto conversion
3. `CRYPTO_PENDING` - Waiting for blockchain confirmation
4. `FIAT_PENDING` - Converting to HKD and initiating bank transfer
5. `COMPLETED` - HKD deposited to Business B's Hong Kong bank account

**Monitoring Payment Status:**

Track the payment progress using:

- **Polling:** Call [Retrieve an offramp](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/offramp/retrieve-an-offramp) with the transaction ID (`63b7f9de-31e9-4726-bf5c-b4f21a6af796`)
- **Webhooks:** Subscribe to `OFFRAMP.UPDATE` events for real-time status notifications

**Settlement Times:**

- **Sandbox:** Instant simulation for testing
- **Production:** Typically 1-3 business days depending on the destination country's banking system and payment rail

<Info>
  **Business Payment Notifications:** Consider implementing webhook handlers to
  send notifications to both Business A (payer) and Business B (recipient) as
  the payment progresses. Include transaction details, exchange rates, and
  expected settlement times to provide transparency and improve cash flow
  management.
