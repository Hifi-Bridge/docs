title: "Global Transfers"
---

Enable businesses to send money internationally through stablecoins with instant settlement. Leverage HIFI's global network to reach recipients in multiple countries with low fees and transparent exchange rates.

**⏱️ Time to complete:** 35-45 minutes

**🎯 What you'll build:** A complete cross-border payment flow where a US business pays a Hong Kong supplier, converting USD → USDC → HKD with instant settlement and competitive rates.

## Use Case Overview

This recipe demonstrates an international B2B payment where:

- ✅ US business deposits USD from their bank account
- ✅ USD automatically converts to USDC stablecoin
- ✅ USDC transfers instantly across borders
- ✅ HKD is deposited to supplier's Hong Kong bank account

This flow enables fast, cost-effective international business payments with transparent pricing and instant settlement.

---

## What you'll build

Here's what we'll accomplish in this recipe:

1. **Generate API Keys** - Set up authentication for HIFI API
2. **Create Business A (Payer)** - Onboard US business and complete KYB verification
3. **Add Virtual Account** - Set up account for USD deposits that convert to USDC
4. **Create Business B (Payee)** - Onboard Hong Kong supplier (or use existing business)
5. **Execute Payment** - Send USDC from Business A → HKD to Business B's bank account

**Payment Flow:**

```
USD → Business A Bank Account → USDC → Business A Wallet → HKD → Business B Bank Account
```

<Note>
  All examples in this guide use the sandbox environment. When you're ready for
  production, simply replace the sandbox URL with the production endpoint and
  use your production API keys.
</Note>

---

## Generate API Keys

Access to the HIFI API requires authentication via API keys. Generate your keys from the HIFI Dashboard before making any API calls. Be sure to copy the key immediately as it’s only shown once.

For a complete guide on API authentication, see our [Authentication Documentation](/docs/api/authentication).

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Using Your API Key">

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of all API requests:

```bash
--header 'authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Create Business A (US Payer)

The paying business needs a verified business account to access fiat payment capabilities and send international payments. Every business must accept HIFI's Terms of Service and complete KYB (Know Your Business) verification before they can move money between fiat and crypto.

## Add Virtual Account (Business A)

Now that Business A has passed KYB, create a **Virtual Account** for onramping. This is a bank account number automatically created by HIFI that the business can deposit USD into. When fiat arrives, it's automatically converted to USDC and sent to their wallet.

## Create Business B (HK Payee)

The recipient business (Business B in Hong Kong) needs a business account with an HKD bank account to receive the payment. Follow the same business creation flow as Business A, but complete KYB verification.

<Note>
  **Using an Existing Business:** If Business B already exists in your system,
  you can skip business creation and just ensure they have an active Hong Kong
  bank account. You'll need their `userId` and `accountId` for the payment
  transaction.
</Note>

### Required Information

To complete this recipe, you'll need:

- **Business B's `userId`** - From creating their business account
- **Business B's HKD `accountId`** - From adding their Hong Kong bank account

For the complete flow of creating Business B and adding their HKD bank account, follow the same steps as Business A but:

1. Use Hong Kong business information and address details
2. Submit KYB verification
3. Add an **Offramp Account** (Hong Kong bank account) instead of a Virtual Account

For detailed instructions on adding offramp accounts for international recipients, see our [Offramp Guide](/docs/transactions/offramps).

---

## Execute Payment

Now you can send the international payment from Business A (US) to Business B (Hong Kong). Create an **offramp** transaction that converts USDC to HKD and sends it to Business B's Hong Kong bank account.

This is a two-step process:

1. **Create offramp request** - Get a quote for the conversion
2. **Accept the quote** - Execute the payment

<Note>
  **Complete Offramp Guide:** For more details on offramps and cross-border
  transfers, see our [Offramp Guide](/docs/transactions/offramps).

    <ResponseField name="rate" type="string">
      Exchange rate (USDC to HKD). In this example: 1 USDC ≈ 7.56 HKD
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="expiresAt" type="string">
      Quote expiration timestamp (ISO 8601 format)

  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

**Understanding the Quote:**

In this example:

- Business A sends **10 USDC**
- After fees (tax: 0.170 USDC, rail: 0.100 USDC), **9.73 USDC** is converted
- At a rate of **7.56 HKD per USDC**
- Business B receives **75.63 HKD** in their Hong Kong bank account

<Warning>
  **Quote Expiration:** Quotes typically expire after 15-30 minutes to protect
  against exchange rate volatility. If your quote expires before acceptance,
  create a new offramp request for a fresh quote with updated rates.
</Warning>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Accept Quote and Execute Payment">

After reviewing the quote, exchange rate, and fees, accept it to execute the cross-border payment using the [Accept Quote](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/offramp/accept-quote) endpoint.

✅ **Quote accepted! Cross-border payment is processing.**

The status has changed from `OPEN_QUOTE` to `CRYPTO_INITIATED`, meaning the transaction is now being executed.

**Cross-Border Payment Status Progression:**

1. `OPEN_QUOTE` - Quote generated, waiting for acceptance
2. `CRYPTO_INITIATED` - Processing crypto conversion
3. `CRYPTO_PENDING` - Waiting for blockchain confirmation
4. `FIAT_PENDING` - Converting to HKD and initiating bank transfer
5. `COMPLETED` - HKD deposited to Business B's Hong Kong bank account

**Monitoring Payment Status:**

Track the payment progress using:

- **Polling:** Call [Retrieve an offramp](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/offramp/retrieve-an-offramp) with the transaction ID (`63b7f9de-31e9-4726-bf5c-b4f21a6af796`)
- **Webhooks:** Subscribe to `OFFRAMP.UPDATE` events for real-time status notifications

**Settlement Times:**

- **Sandbox:** Instant simulation for testing
- **Production:** Typically 1-3 business days depending on the destination country's banking system and payment rail

<Info>
  **Business Payment Notifications:** Consider implementing webhook handlers to
  send notifications to both Business A (payer) and Business B (recipient) as
  the payment progresses. Include transaction details, exchange rates, and
  expected settlement times to provide transparency and improve cash flow
  management.
