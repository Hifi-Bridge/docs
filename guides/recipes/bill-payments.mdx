title: "Bill Payments"
---

Facilitate automated bill payment services for utilities, subscriptions, and other recurring expenses. Use virtual accounts to collect payments from users and route funds to billers automatically. Support batch transfers to process multiple payments efficiently, reducing operational overhead while ensuring timely settlements.

**⏱️ Time to complete:** 25-35 minutes

**🎯 What you'll build:** An automated bill payment system where users deposit USD into a virtual account, funds convert to USDC, then batch transfers pay multiple billers (utilities, subscriptions, etc.) in a single transaction.

## Use Case Overview

This recipe demonstrates an automated bill payment flow where:

- ✅ Users deposit USD into dedicated virtual accounts
- ✅ USD automatically converts to USDC stablecoin
- ✅ Batch transfers distribute payments to multiple billers
- ✅ Operational overhead is minimized through automation

This flow enables scalable bill payment services with reduced processing costs and timely settlements.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **API keys** from the Dashboard ([Get API keys](/docs/api/authentication))
- **A tool for making API calls** (cURL, Postman, or similar)
- **Basic understanding of REST APIs**
- **Your sandbox endpoint:** `https://sandbox.hifibridge.com`

<Note>
  All examples in this guide use the sandbox environment. When you're ready for
  production, simply replace the sandbox URL with the production endpoint and
  use your production API keys.
</Note>

---

## What you'll build

Here's what we'll accomplish in this recipe:

1. **Generate API Keys** - Set up authentication for HIFI API
2. **Create User** - Onboard a bill payer and complete KYC for USD rail
3. **Add Virtual Account** - Set up account for collecting USD payments that convert to USDC
4. **Execute Batch Transfer** - Pay multiple billers in a single transaction

**Payment Flow:**

```
USD → User Bank Account → Virtual Account → USDC → Batch Transfer → Multiple Billers
```

---

## Generate API Keys

Access to the HIFI API requires authentication via API keys. Generate your keys from the HIFI Dashboard before making any API calls.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Get Your API Keys">

**Steps:**

1. Navigate to [dashboard.hifibridge.com](https://dashboard.hifibridge.com/)
2. Log in to your account
3. Go to **Developer → API Keys**
4. Click **Generate New Key**
5. Select your environment: **Sandbox** (for testing) or **Production** (for live transactions)
6. Copy the key immediately - it's only shown once

**Important Security Notes:**

- Store your API key securely (environment variables, secrets manager, etc.)
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Your key authenticates all HIFI API requests
- If compromised, immediately revoke in the Dashboard and generate a new one

<Warning>
  **API keys are shown only once.** If you lose your key, you must revoke it and
  generate a new one. There is no way to retrieve a lost key.
</Warning>

**Using Your API Key:**

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of all API requests:

```bash
--header 'authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

For a complete guide on API authentication, see our [Authentication Documentation](/docs/api/authentication).

  </Accordion>

## Create User (Bill Payer)

Create a verified user account for the bill payer. Every user must accept HIFI's Terms of Service and complete KYC verification before they can access fiat rails and make payments.

<Note>
  **Complete Onboarding Guide:** For a comprehensive walkthrough of user
  onboarding and KYC verification, see our [User Guide](/docs/users).
</Note>

### User Creation Flow

Creating a user involves four steps:

1. **Generate Terms of Service Link** - Get acceptance link for your customer
2. **Create User** - Create the user account after TOS acceptance
3. **Update KYC Information** - Provide required personal details
4. **Submit KYC** - Submit for verification to unlock USD rail

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Generate Terms of Service Link">

Before creating a user, they must accept HIFI's Terms of Service. Generate a unique acceptance link using the [Generate Terms of Service Link](https://docs.hifibridge.com/v2/reference/post_v2-tos-link) endpoint.

**Request:**

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/tos-link \
  --header 'accept: application/json' \
  --header 'authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '
{
  "idempotencyKey": "c9c91801-d3a2-4a1c-aa2e-fcb2c473198c"
}
'
```

**Request Fields:**

<ResponseField name="idempotencyKey" type="string" required>
  A unique UUID that becomes your `signedAgreementId` after the user accepts the
  terms. Generate this using any [UUID
  generator](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/).
</ResponseField>

**Response:**

```json
{
  "signedAgreementId": "c9c91801-d3a2-4a1c-aa2e-fcb2c473198c",
  "url": "https://dashboard.hifibridge.com/accept-terms-of-service?sessionToken=536bb03a..."
}
```

**Response Fields:**

<ResponseField name="url" type="string">
  The unique link where your user will review and accept HIFI's Terms of
  Service.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="signedAgreementId" type="string">
  The agreement ID (same as your `idempotencyKey`). **Save this** - you'll need
  it to create the user in the next step.
</ResponseField>

**What to do with this response:**

1. **Direct your user to the `url`** - Present this link to your end user (via email, in your app, etc.)
2. **Save the `signedAgreementId`** - You'll need this to create the user in the next step
3. **Wait for acceptance** - The `signedAgreementId` becomes valid only after the user clicks "Accept"

<Info>
  **Real-time Notifications:** HIFI triggers the `TOS_LINK.UPDATE` webhook event
  when the user accepts the terms, allowing you to proceed with user creation
  immediately. [Learn about webhooks →](/docs/webhooks)
</Info>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Create User">

Once your user has accepted the Terms of Service, create the user account with the [Create User](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/user/create-a-user) endpoint.

## Add Virtual Account

Now that the user has passed KYC, create a **Virtual Account** for collecting bill payments. This is a bank account number automatically created by HIFI that users can deposit USD into. When fiat arrives, it's automatically converted to USDC and sent to their wallet, ready for batch distribution to billers.

<Note>
  **Virtual Account for Bill Payments:** Each virtual account comes with unique
  ACH/wire/RTP details you can surface in your app. When deposits arrive, HIFI
  detects the funds, applies your conversion settings (e.g., USD → USDC), and
  makes them available for scheduled or batch payouts to billers.
</Note>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create Virtual Account">

<Info>
  **How to Use:** Provide these deposit instructions to your users through your
  app/website. When they send money to this account via their bank, HIFI
  automatically detects the deposit, converts it to USDC, and sends it to their
  wallet. The USDC is then available for batch bill payments. For monitoring
  deposits, subscribe to `ONRAMP.CREATE` webhook events.
</Info>

For a complete guide on virtual accounts and onramping, see our [Virtual Accounts Guide](/docs/virtual-accounts).

## Execute Batch Transfer

With deposits flowing into the virtual account and converting to USDC, create a **batch transfer** to pay multiple billers at once. Send one request containing every destination wallet address and amount; HIFI processes the entire batch and returns itemized statuses for your records.

<Note>
  **Batch Transfer Benefits:** Batch transfers reduce operational overhead by
  consolidating multiple payments into a single transaction. This is ideal for
  bill payment services where you need to distribute funds to multiple
  utilities, subscription services, or other billers on a regular schedule.
</Note>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create Batch Transfer">

Create a batch transfer to pay multiple billers in a single transaction using the [Create Batch Transfer](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/crypto-transfer/create-batch-transfer) endpoint.

In this example, we'll pay three different billers (utilities, subscriptions, etc.) with 10 USDC each from the user's wallet.

**Understanding the Batch Transfer:**

In this example:

- **Source:** User's wallet (`0x63dA...C338`) with 30+ USDC available
- **Batch:** 3 billers receiving 10 USDC each
- **Total:** 30 USDC distributed in a single blockchain transaction
- **Cost Savings:** One transaction fee instead of three separate transactions

  **Monitoring Batch Transfers:** Subscribe to `WALLET.TRANSFER.BATCH.UPDATE`
  webhook events to receive real-time notifications as the batch progresses. You
  can also poll the [Retrieve Batch
  Transfer](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/crypto-transfer/retrieve-batch-transfer)
  endpoint to check individual payment statuses within the batch.
