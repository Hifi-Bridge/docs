title: "KYC Documents"

KYC documents are required for identity verification and compliance. The document requirements differ significantly between individual users, businesses, and Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs).

## Document Overview

Documents serve to verify:

- **Identity** - Who the user is
- **Address** - Where the user resides
- **Business legitimacy** - For business accounts, proof of legal existence and ownership
- **Ownership structure** - Who controls the business

All documents must be uploaded through the [Documents API](/docs/compliance/documents) before submitting KYC for review.

## Individual Documents

For individual users, document requirements are straightforward:

### Required Document Groups

**Identity Group** (minimum 1 document):

- Driver's License (front + back)
- ID Card (front + back)
- Passport
- Residence Permit

**Address Group** (may be required or optional):

- Utility bill
- Bank statement
- Lease agreement

### Key Characteristics

- **Simple structure**: Typically only 1-2 document groups
- **Personal identity**: Focus on verifying the individual's identity and residence
- **Single upload per document**: Each document type is uploaded once (except driver's license/ID card which need both sides)

## Business Documents

Business accounts require significantly more documentation to verify legal existence, ownership, and control structure.

### Required Document Groups

Businesses must satisfy multiple document groups:

**Legal Presence** (minimum 1 document):

- Incorporation Articles
- Incorporation Certificate
- State Registry

**Ownership Structure** (minimum 1 document):

- Shareholder Registry
- Trust Agreement
- Information Statement
- State Registry

**Company Details** (minimum 1 document):

- Proof of Address

**Control Structure** (minimum 1 document):

- Directors Registry
- Trust Agreement
- Information Statement
- State Registry

### Key Characteristics

- **Multiple document groups**: Businesses must satisfy 4+ document groups
- **Legal verification**: Documents prove the business legally exists and is registered
- **Ownership transparency**: Documents reveal who owns and controls the business
- **Regulatory compliance**: Required to meet financial regulations for business accounts

<Info>
  **Document Types:** Some document types (like STATE_REGISTRY) can satisfy
  multiple groups, but you still need to provide enough documents to satisfy
  each group's minimum count requirement.
</Info>

## Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) Documents

UBOs are individuals who own or control a business. Each UBO with more than 25% ownership must provide their own identity documents.

### UBO Requirements

**Who needs to provide documents:**

- Any individual with **>25% ownership** in the business
- Must include at least one **DIRECTOR** and one **UBO** role across all UBOs

**Required for each UBO:**

**Personal Information:**

- First name, last name, middle name (optional)
- Date of birth
- Nationality
- Email, phone
- Address (full address details)
- Tax identification number
- Business title
- Share proportion
- Relationship established date

**Identity Documents** (minimum 1 document):

- Driver's License
- ID Card
- Passport
- Residence Permit

### Key Characteristics

- **Individual-level verification**: Each UBO is verified like an individual user
- **Ownership threshold**: Only UBOs with >25% ownership need to be provided
- **Role requirements**: Combined roles across all UBOs must include at least one DIRECTOR and one UBO
- **Separate document uploads**: Each UBO's documents are uploaded separately

<Warning>
  **Important:** UBO documents are uploaded separately from business documents.
  Each UBO requires their own identity document uploads through the UBO-specific
  endpoints.
</Warning>

## Document Workflow

The document upload process follows these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Upload file">
    Upload the document file using the [Upload
    File](/docs/api-reference/files/upload-file) endpoint to get a `fileId`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Add document">
    Associate the file with the user/business/UBO using the appropriate
    endpoint: - **Individual/Business**: [Add
    Documents](/docs/api-reference/kyc/add-documents) - **UBO**: [Add UBO
    Documents](/docs/api-reference/kyc/add-ubo-documents)
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Verify requirements">
    Check [KYC Requirements](/docs/kyc/kyc-requirements) to ensure all required
    document groups are satisfied.
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Submit KYC">
    Once all documents are uploaded, submit KYC for review.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Scenarios

### Individual User

- Upload 1 identity document (e.g., passport)
- Upload 1 proof of address (if required)
- Submit KYC

### Business User

- Upload business documents (legal presence, ownership, control, company details)
- Add UBOs with their personal information
- Upload identity documents for each UBO (>25% ownership)
- Submit KYB

### Business with Multiple UBOs

- Upload all business documents
- Add UBO #1: Personal info + identity documents
- Add UBO #2: Personal info + identity documents
- Add UBO #3: Personal info + identity documents
- Ensure combined roles include DIRECTOR and UBO
- Submit KYB

## Document Status

After uploading documents, they progress through verification:

- **PENDING_REVIEW**: Document uploaded, awaiting verification
- **APPROVED**: Document verified and accepted
- **REJECTED**: Document rejected (check rejection reason)
- **EXPIRED**: Document expired and needs replacement

Monitor document status through the [KYC Status](/docs/kyc/kyc-status) endpoint or [webhook events](/docs/webhooks/kyc-events).
