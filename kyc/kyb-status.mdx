title: "KYB Status"
---

To check where a business's verification stands, diagnose issues, and confirm when they're ready to use a rail, use the [KYC Status endpoint](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/kyc/retrieve-kyc-status). This guide focuses on interpreting the business-specific response.

<Tip>
  Read the [KYC Status](/kyc/kyc-status) guide first—it explains the compliance screening structure without Ultimate Beneficial Owners.
</Tip>

<Note>
  This guide focuses on the USD rail. Requirements and response structure differ for other rails—see the [API
  Reference](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/kyc/retrieve-kyc-status) for complete details.
</Note>

## Status Overview

Business KYB applications move through the same statuses as individual KYC:

| Status              | Description                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **INACTIVE**        | No KYB submitted yet—call Submit KYC to begin verification                         |
| **INCOMPLETE**      | Submitted data needs updates—fix flagged items and resubmit                        |
| **PENDING**         | KYB submitted and is moving through automated compliance checks or bank onboarding |
| **MANUAL_REVIEW**   | Compliance team manually reviewing before final decision                           |
| **RFI_PENDING**     | Compliance requested additional information—check your compliance email            |
| **ACTIVE**          | Business passed compliance review and can use the USD rail                         |
| **REJECTED**        | Permanently denied for USD rail—resubmission not permitted                         |
| **CONTACT_SUPPORT** | System couldn't confirm status—contact HIFI support                                |

<Info>
  Contact support if a business applicant remains in `PENDING` or `MANUAL_REVIEW` for more than 3 days.

    **How to resolve:**

    1. Check the `reviewResult` in each compliance category for `DECLINED` items
    2. Read the `comment` field for specific guidance
    3. For company data: Use [**Update KYC**](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/kyc/update-kyc-information) to update non-document information, or [**Update Document**](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/kyc/update-a-document) / [**Add Document**](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/kyc/add-documents) to update documentation.
    4. For UBO data: Update the specific UBO's information using their `id` with [Update UBO](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/kyc/update-a-ubo) or [**Update Document**](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/kyc/update-a-document) / [**Add Document**](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/kyc/add-documents) to update documentation.
    5. Call [Submit KYC](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/kyc/submit-kyc) to trigger a new review
