    **How to resolve:**

    1. Check the `reviewResult` in each compliance category for `DECLINED` items
    2. Read the `comment` field for specific guidance
    3. Use [**Update KYC**](https://docs.hifi.com/api-reference/kyc/update-kyc-information) to update non-document information, or [**Update Document**](https://docs.hifi.com/api-reference/kyc/update-a-document)** / **[**Add Document**](https://docs.hifi.com/api-reference/kyc/add-documents) to update documentation.
    4. Call [Submit KYC](https://docs.hifi.com/api-reference/kyc/submit-kyc) to trigger a new review
