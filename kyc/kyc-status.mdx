Use the KYC Status endpoint to check where a user's verification stands, diagnose issues, and confirm when they're ready to use a rail.

<Note>
  This guide focuses on the USD rail. Requirements and response structure differ
  for other rails—see the [API
  Reference](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/kyc/retrieve-kyc-status)
  for complete details.

    **How to resolve:**

    1. Check the `reviewResult` in each compliance category for `DECLINED` items
    2. Read the `comment` field for specific guidance
    3. Use [Update KYC](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/kyc/update-kyc-information) to fix the issues
    4. Call [Submit KYC](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/kyc/submit-kyc) to trigger a new review
