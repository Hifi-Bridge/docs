## API Environments

HIFI provides two environments for development and production:

| Environment    | Base URL                            | Purpose                                             |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sandbox**    | `https://sandbox.hifibridge.com`    | Testing and development with simulated transactions |
| **Production** | `https://production.hifibridge.com` | Live transactions with real money movement          |

## Creating API Keys

### Access the API Keys Section

1. Log in to the [HIFI Dashboard](https://app.hifi.com)
2. Navigate to **Developer** → **API Keys**  
   Or go directly to: [app.hifi.com/developer/apiKeys](https://app.hifi.com/developer/apiKeys)

### Select Your Environment

Choose which environment you're creating keys for:

- **Sandbox** - For testing and development
- **Production** - For live operations

<Info>
  **Best Practice:** Start with sandbox keys to build and test your integration
  before moving to production.
</Info>

### Generate a New API Key

1. Click the **"Create API Key"** or **"New API Key"** button
2. Provide a descriptive name that identifies the key's purpose  
   Examples:

   - "Production Web App"
   - "Staging Server"
   - "Mobile App Development"
   - "Webhook Service"

3. Click **"Generate"** to create the key

### Copy and Secure Your API Key

<Warning>
  API keys are shown only once at creation. If you lose your key, you'll need to
  generate a new one and update your application.
</Warning>

**After generation:**

1. ✅ **Immediately copy the API key** from the dashboard
2. ✅ **Store it securely** in your environment variables or secrets manager
3. ✅ **Never commit keys** to version control (Git, SVN, etc.)
4. ✅ **Never expose keys** in client-side code or public repositories

**Example of secure storage:**

```bash
# .env file (add to .gitignore)
HIFI_API_KEY=zpka_1234567890abcdef
HIFI_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
```

## Managing API Keys

### Deleting API Keys

If a key is compromised or no longer needed:

1. Navigate to **Developer** → **API Keys** in the dashboard
2. Find the key you want to delete
3. Click **"Delete"** or the delete icon
4. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
  Deleted keys stop working immediately. Ensure you've updated your application
  with a new key before deleting the old one.
</Warning>

## Testing Your API Key

Verify your API key is working correctly with the ping endpoint:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/ping" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

**Successful response:**

```json
{
  "message": "pong"
}
```

**Authentication error:**

```json
{
  "error": "Not authorized"
}
```
