A **User** represents an individual or a business entity interacting with the HIFI platform.
Users are the foundation of most HIFI operations: before you can create wallets or move money, a user record must exist.

HIFI supports two types of users:

- **Individual** – a natural person (e.g., a customer, freelancer, or employee).
- **Business** – a legal entity (e.g., a company, NGO, or partnership).

## Terms of Service

A **Terms of Service agreement ID** is required to create a user.
This ensures you have consent for data handling, compliance screening, and financial activity.

You can obtain a TOS agreement ID in two ways:

1. **Using the API** – Call the [Generate Terms of Service Link](/api-reference/user/generate-a-terms-of-service-link) endpoint with an idempotency key to get a unique URL. After users accept the terms at this link, the key becomes your signed agreement ID.

2. **Using the Dashboard** – On the Dashboard, you can simply click a button when creating a user to accept the TOS link.

## KYC

To interact with fiat accounts, HIFI enforces **KYC (Know Your Customer)** and **KYB (Know Your Business)** checks to comply with financial regulations.

KYC verification typically takes:

- **Individual Users**: 1 business day
- **Business Users**: 1-3 business days, depending on complexity

During the onboarding process, you'll be asked to provide a **compliance email address**. This email will be used to contact you for any additional information requests during KYC review.
