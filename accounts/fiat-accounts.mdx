title: "Fiat Accounts"

The **Fiat Account Rail** (`fiat_account`) is a custodial fiat account offering for end users. It enables users to deposit fiat currency into a personal account via SWIFT and then hold or send that balance. For example, an end user might SWIFT in $100 into their HIFI fiat account. Later, they could send $40 to a beneficiary's bank account (e.g., a payroll payout to an employee) via SWIFT.

<Warning>
  **Rail Unlock Required:** Users must unlock the `fiat_account` rail before they can create fiat accounts. This is a separate rail from the USD Rail and requires its own KYC/KYB verification. See [Rails Overview](/docs/rails) for more information about unlocking rails.
</Warning>

## Unlocking the Fiat Account Rail

Before users can create fiat accounts, they must unlock the `fiat_account` rail. This requires completing KYC (for individuals) or KYB (for businesses) verification specific to this rail.

<Info>
  The Fiat Account Rail is independent from other rails. Unlocking the USD Rail, Global Network Rail, or Africa Rail does not automatically unlock the Fiat Account Rail. Each rail requires separate verification.
