Our sandbox environment provides a safe testing space to integrate our APIs. All transactions are simulated and hold no real-world value.

## Getting started

### Generate a sandbox API key

1. **Request Access** - Visit [dashboard.hifi.com/request-access](https://dashboard.hifi.com/request-access) to schedule a call with our team and get onboarded.
2. **Navigate to API Keys** - Once approved, go to the Developer Dashboard
3. **Create New Key** - Click the "New API Key" button under Sandbox

<Warning>
  Keep your sandbox API key secure and never commit it to version control. Use environment variables to store API keys in your applications.
</Warning>

### Sandbox Base URL

All sandbox API requests should be made to:

```
https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/
```

**Example request:**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/ping" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SANDBOX_API_KEY"
```

## Sandbox vs Production

The sandbox environment is designed to simulate production behavior while providing a safe testing environment:

| Feature            | Sandbox                          | Production                          |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **API Base URL**   | `https://sandbox.hifibridge.com` | `https://production.hifibridge.com` |
| **KYC Processing** | Auto-approved                    | Real-world compliance checks        |
| **Blockchain**     | Testnet                          | Mainnet                             |
| **Tokens**         | No real value                    | Real cryptocurrency                 |

### Automated KYC Approval

In sandbox, the KYC process is streamlined for testing:

- **Typically Auto-Approved** - KYC submissions are usually approved within minutes
- **Compliance Checks Still Apply** - Some compliance checks (like PEP screening) may still block approval even in sandbox
- **Dummy Data** - Use any test personal information and documents

<Warning>
  While KYC is typically auto-approved in sandbox, certain compliance checks may still block approval. For example, PEP (Politically Exposed Person) screening can prevent sandbox users from unlocking rails even in the test environment.
</Warning>

<Info>
  In production, KYC applications undergo real compliance review

### Forcing KYC Outcomes in Sandbox

You can force specific KYC outcomes in sandbox by setting the applicant's last name to one of these reserved keywords:

| Last Name | Outcome |
| :-------- | :------ |
| `PENDING`  | KYC application will remain in `PENDING` status |
| `APPROVAL` | KYC application will be automatically approved (`ACTIVE` status) |
| `REJECTION` | KYC application will be automatically rejected (`REJECTED` status) |

**Example: Force approval**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/users/usr_abc123/kyc" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "APPROVAL",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "dateOfBirth": "1990-01-01",
    "nationality": "USA",
    "taxIdentificationNumber": "123456789"
  }'
```

After submitting KYC with one of these last names, the application will automatically transition to the corresponding status, allowing you to test different KYC states without waiting for manual review.

<Note>
  **Sandbox Only:** This feature only works in the sandbox environment. In production, KYC outcomes are determined by real compliance review.
</Note>

### Simulated Transactions

All money movement in sandbox is simulated:

- **Virtual Deposits** - Use an endpoint to mimic bank deposits
- **Testnet Token** - Transaction uses testnet tokens and is processed on a testnet network
- **Testnet Wallets** - All wallet addresses are on blockchain testnets

---

## Transitioning to production

When you're ready to move from sandbox to production:

1. **Generate production API keys** in the dashboard
2. **Update your base URL** from `sandbox.hifibridge.com` to `production.hifibridge.com`
3. **Update API keys** in your environment variables
4. **Remove simulation calls** - Delete any simulate-deposit endpoint usage
5. **Enable real KYC** - Provide real user information and documents
6. **Test thoroughly** - Start with small transactions before scaling

<Warning>
  Never use sandbox API keys in production or production keys in sandbox. They are environment-specific and won't work cross-environment.
</Warning>
