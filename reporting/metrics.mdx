Track transaction volume, activity patterns, and user growth with configurable metrics. Build custom views using templates, apply filters, and break down data by dimensions like transaction direction or user.

## Core Concepts

**Metric Templates** define what you're measuring—gross volume, transaction counts, or new users.

**Saved Metrics** are optional—use them to persist configurations for recurring queries or create custom metrics for specific use cases.

**Breakdowns** split metrics into groups (by transaction type, status, or user) for deeper analysis.

## Available Metric Types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Gross Volume">
    Measure total transaction value over time. Returns volume in original currency and USD equivalent.

    **Common uses:**

    - Track daily, weekly, or monthly payment volume
    - Monitor revenue trends
    - Compare volume across transaction types

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transaction Count">
    Count the number of transactions within a period.

    **Common uses:**

    - Measure transaction activity
    - Calculate success rates by status
    - Track user-specific transaction patterns

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="New Users">
    Count users acquired within a time period.

    **Common uses:**

    - Monitor user acquisition
    - Track onboarding velocity
    - Measure growth by period

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick Start

1. **List templates** - See available metric types and their breakdown options
2. **Preview metrics** - Test queries without saving using the preview endpoint
3. **Save metrics** (optional) - Persist configurations for recurring queries
4. **Query results** - Retrieve data from saved metrics or preview endpoints

<Note>
  For detailed examples and step-by-step guides, see the [Reporting
  Guide](/guides/reporting).

## Configuration Options

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Date Range">
    Every metric requires a date range using ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). Available parameters vary by template—check the template response for supported params.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Calculation Interval">
  Choose how to aggregate data over time: `day`, `week`, `month`, `quarter`, or
  `year`. Daily aggregation returns one row per day in your date range.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Filters">
  Narrow results to specific subsets by users, transaction types, or transaction
  statuses. Available filters depend on the template.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Breakdowns">
    Split metrics by dimensions for comparison: `transactionType`, `transactionStatus`, or `userId`. Without breakdowns, you get one row per time period. With breakdowns, you get multiple rows per period—one for each unique combination of breakdown values.

    <Note>
      Check each template's `breakdownOptions` field. NEW_USERS doesn't support breakdowns.
    </Note>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Use Cases

- **Track volume by transaction type** - Separate volume numbers for onramps and offramps
- **Monitor specific user activity** - Transaction counts for specific users, broken down by success/failure
- **Measure user acquisition** - New user count over time periods

<Note>
  See the [Reporting Guide](/guides/reporting) for detailed examples with code
  samples.

## Managing Saved Metrics

Create, view, update, and delete saved metrics using the Metrics API endpoints. Saved metrics persist your configuration for recurring queries or custom user-specific metrics.

## Best Practices

**Use preview to experiment.** The preview endpoint lets you try any metric without saving. Test different parameters and breakdowns to find what works.

**Save only when needed.** Create saved metrics for recurring queries or custom user-specific metrics. Most one-off queries work fine with preview.

**Start simple.** Begin with basic metrics (no filters, no breakdowns) then add complexity as needed.

**Choose appropriate intervals.** Daily intervals give granular data but can be overwhelming for long periods. Monthly or quarterly intervals work better for high-level trends.

**Use breakdowns strategically.** Each breakdown dimension multiplies your result rows. Combine `transactionType` and `transactionStatus` breakdowns carefully—you'll get rows for every combination.

**Check template parameters.** Available parameters vary by template. Review the template response to see what filters and options each metric supports.
