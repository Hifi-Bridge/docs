## Reporting

We're excited to announce our new **Reporting** feature! This powerful addition to the HIFI API and Dashboard enables you to generate comprehensive metrics and reports for your payment operations.

With the Reporting API, you can:

- Create custom reporting templates tailored to your needs
- Generate metrics on transfers, accounts, and user activity
- Preview report results before finalizing
- Access detailed reporting data through our REST API

Get started by reading the [Reporting guide](/features/reporting) or exploring the Reporting endpoints in the [API Reference](/api-reference/reporting).
