## Reporting

We're excited to announce our new **Metrics API**! This powerful addition enables you to generate comprehensive data and reports for your payment operations.

With the Metrics API, you can:

- Generate metrics on transactions and user activity
- Preview report results before finalizing
- Create custom reporting templates tailored to your needs
- Access detailed reports through the API and Dashboard

Get started by reading the [Metrics docs](/reporting/metrics), the [Reporting guide](/guides/reporting), or exploring the new endpoints in the [API Reference](/api-reference/reporting).
