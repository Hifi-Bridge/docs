## Transfer Approvals for Offramps

Transfer approvals are now available for offramp transactions. You can require approval before executing offramp transfers (stablecoin to fiat conversions) to add an extra layer of security and compliance control.

**Dashboard Approvals:**
- Members can now initiate offramp transactions
- All member-initiated offramp transactions will **always** enter the transfer approval flow and require Admin approval

**API Approvals:**
- Offramp transactions will enter the transfer approval flow **only** if `requireApproval: true` is set in the request body

**Additional details:**
- For offramps with `requireApproval: true`, quotes are generated **after** approval to prevent quotes from expiring while awaiting review. This matches the behavior for bridging transfers.
- **Expiration times:** Transfers in `PENDING_APPROVAL` status will automatically expire if not approved or rejected:
  - **Onchain transfers** (wallet transfers, batch transfers, bridging): Expire after **1 week**
  - **Offramps**: Expire after **1 day**

See the [Transfer Approvals documentation](/features/transfer-approvals) for more details.
