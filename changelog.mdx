<Update label="February 13, 2026" description="Transaction status and event updates">

## New IN_REVIEW Status

Transactions under compliance review will now show an explicit **IN_REVIEW** status before progressing to fund transfer states:

- **Onramp:** IN_REVIEW → FIAT_PENDING
- **Offramp:** IN_REVIEW → CRYPTO_INITIATED
- **Crypto Transfers:** IN_REVIEW → INITIATED

Previously, transactions remained in FIAT_PENDING (Onramp) or CRYPTO_INITIATED (Offramp) during review, making monitoring unclear.

## Legacy Events Deprecated

**ONRAMP.UPDATE**, **OFFRAMP.UPDATE**, **ONRAMP.CREATE**, and **OFFRAMP.CREATE** will no longer be supported. Update your integrations to use the new transaction events documented in our [Onramp events](/webhooks/onramp-events) and [Offramp events](/webhooks/offramp-events) sections to avoid service disruptions.

If you have any questions, please [contact us](/contact) or review our documentation.

## New Dashboard (Pilot)

We're rolling out a pilot of the new HIFI Dashboard, redesigned to support enhanced developer workflows and faster compliance operations.

**What's New:**

- Rebuilt from the ground up for speed and performance
- Faster compliance experience with improved error handling
- New homepage, reports page, and approvals section
- Integrated support to send messages to Slack directly

**Try it now:** [app.hifi.com](https://app.hifi.com)

The current Dashboard will be phased out at the end of February.

### New KYC Status: RFI Pending

We've introduced a new compliance status to provide clearer visibility into review progress.

- Submissions will briefly be in `PENDING` (~ 2m)
- After this, the submission will progress to:
  - `MANUAL_REVIEW` - Your application is under review by our compliance team
  - `RFI_PENDING` - Additional information is required (Request sent via email)
  - `APPROVED`/`REJECTED` - Final state

## Improvements

### Proof of Address Automation for KYC Process

The Proof of Address (PoA) request process has been streamlined to reduce email dependency whilst improving turnaround time.

- KYC PoA RFIs will no longer trigger email notifications
- Instead, you can submit the PoA directly from the Dashboard or API

Please refer to this document for a step-by-step guide to the technical integration process.

</Update>

<Update label="December 23, 2025" description="New feature">

## Transaction Approvals for Offramps

Transaction approvals are now available for offramp transactions. You can require approval before executing offramp transactions (stablecoin to fiat conversions) to add an extra layer of security and compliance control.

**Dashboard Approvals:**

- Members can now initiate offramp transactions
- All member-initiated offramp transactions will **always** enter the transaction approval flow and require Admin approval

**API Approvals:**

- Offramp transactions will enter the transaction approval flow **only** if `requireApproval: true` is set in the request body

**Additional details:**

- For offramps that enter the transaction approval flow, quotes are generated **after** approval to prevent quotes from expiring while awaiting review. This matches the behavior for bridging transfers.
- **Expiration times:** Transactions in `PENDING_APPROVAL` status will automatically expire if not approved or rejected:
  - **Onchain transfers** (wallet transfers, batch transfers, bridging): Expire after **1 week**
  - **Offramps**: Expire after **1 day**

See the [Transaction Approvals documentation](/features/transaction-approvals) for more details.
