## Updates

- Added a "Find User" feature on the Dashboard Compliance page to help check KYC status quickly.
- Changed Transfers page on the Dashboard to Transactions. HIFI supports three transaction types: transfers (onchain), onramps and offramps. We also improved legibility in drawers.
- Implemented retries for wallet swaps to improve reliability.

## Fixes

- Fixed a bug related to fee charging for refund wallet transfers.
- Updated the Global Network KYC response object to show a failed status when the sender's country is unsupported, instead of throwing errors.
- Fixed an issue with required fields for KYC Links.
- Fixed an issue disabling production access for some customers.
