## Metrics API

We're excited to announce our new **Metrics** API! This powerful addition enables you to generate comprehensive data and reports for your payment operations.

With the Metric API, you can:

- Create custom reporting templates tailored to your needs
- Generate metrics on transactions and user activity
- Preview report results before finalizing
- Access detailed reporting data through our REST API

Get started by reading the [Metrics docs](/reporting/metrics), the [Reporting guide](/guides/reporting), or exploring the Reporting endpoints in the [API Reference](/api-reference/reporting).
