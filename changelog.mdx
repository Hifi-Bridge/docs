## Transaction Approvals for Offramps

Transaction approvals are now available for offramp transactions. You can require approval before executing offramp transactions (stablecoin to fiat conversions) to add an extra layer of security and compliance control.

**Dashboard Approvals:**

- Members can now initiate offramp transactions
- All member-initiated offramp transactions will **always** enter the transaction approval flow and require Admin approval

**API Approvals:**

- Offramp transactions will enter the transaction approval flow **only** if `requireApproval: true` is set in the request body

**Additional details:**

- For offramps that enter the transaction approval flow, quotes are generated **after** approval to prevent quotes from expiring while awaiting review. This matches the behavior for bridging transfers.
- **Expiration times:** Transactions in `PENDING_APPROVAL` status will automatically expire if not approved or rejected:
  - **Onchain transfers** (wallet transfers, batch transfers, bridging): Expire after **1 week**
  - **Offramps**: Expire after **1 day**

See the [Transaction Approvals documentation](/features/transaction-approvals) for more details.
