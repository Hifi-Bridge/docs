title: "Developer Fees"
---

**Developer Fees** enable automated calculation and distribution of fees for offramp transactions. Fees can be configured to be distributed to up to **10 different beneficiary wallets**.

<Info>
Developer fees work for offramp transactions. Looking to charge fees for Virtual Accounts? Try [Settlement Rules](/docs/features/settlement-rules).
</Info>

## How Developer Fees Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define fees and beneficiary">
    Specify the fee calculation method and destination wallets by including the developer fee when creating offramp transactions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic distribution">
    Fees are automatically calculated and distributed during the offramp process. The total amount (offramp amount + fees) is debited from the source wallet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fee settlement">
    After the offramp is processed, fees are credited to the specified beneficiary wallets in stablecoin.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported Rails

<Info>
Developer fees are currently supported for USD offramps only. Additional currencies and payment rails—including global fiat currencies and non-USD transfer methods—will be supported soon. Stay tuned for updates!
</Info>

## Fee Models

HIFI currently supports two types of fee models:

- **Percentage:** The fee is calculated based on the amount being converted into fiat.
- **Flat:** The fee is charged as a fixed amount, regardless of the amount being converted into fiat.

All fees are added on top of the offramp amount and credited to the beneficiary wallet in stablecoin.

### Fee Calculation Example

An offramp transaction with an amount of **100 USDC** and two developer fees:

- **20 bps (0.002)** as a percentage, credited to **Beneficiary Wallet A**
- **5 USDC** as a flat fee, credited to **Beneficiary Wallet B**

When the offramp transaction is initiated, a total of **105.2 USDC** (100 + 100 × 0.002 + 5) will be debited from the sender's wallet. After settlement:

- **100 USDC** will be converted into fiat and sent to the recipient's bank account
- **0.2 USDC** will be delivered to **Wallet A**
- **5 USDC** will be delivered to **Wallet B**

## Applying Developer Fees

Include the `developerFee` field when creating an offramp transaction to automatically calculate and distribute fees.

## Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Fee Models">
    HIFI supports two fee calculation models:
    
    **Percentage Fees:**
    - Calculated as a percentage of the offramp amount
    - Specified as a decimal value (e.g., `"0.002"` for 0.2% or 20 basis points)
    - Example: 0.2% of 100 USDC = 0.2 USDC
    
    **Flat Fees:**
    - Fixed amount regardless of transaction size
    - Specified as a string value (e.g., `"5"` for 5 USDC)
    - Example: 5 USDC flat fee
    
    Both models can be combined in a single transaction with up to 10 different beneficiary wallets.
  </Accordion>

  {" "}

  <Accordion title="Fee Distribution">
    Developer fees work as follows:
    
    1. **Total debit**: The source wallet is debited for the offramp amount plus all fees
    2. **Offramp processing**: The offramp amount is converted to fiat and sent to the bank account
    3. **Fee distribution**: Each fee is credited to its specified beneficiary wallet in stablecoin
    
    The `amountIncludeDeveloperFee` field in the response shows the total amount debited, helping you calculate the exact amount needed in the source wallet.
  </Accordion>

  {" "}

  <Accordion title="Multiple Beneficiaries">
    You can distribute fees to up to 10 different beneficiary wallets in a single transaction:
    
    ```json
    {
      "developerFee": {
        "fees": [
          {
            "type": "PERCENTAGE",
            "value": "0.001",
            "walletAddress": "0xWallet1..."
          },
          {
            "type": "PERCENTAGE",
            "value": "0.001",
            "walletAddress": "0xWallet2..."
          },
          {
            "type": "FLAT",
            "value": "1",
            "walletAddress": "0xWallet3..."
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
    
    Fees are distributed in the order they are specified in the array.
  </Accordion>

  {" "}

  <Accordion title="Fee Tracking">
    Each developer fee has:
    
    - **id**: Unique identifier for the fee instance
    - **transactionHash**: Blockchain transaction hash for fee distribution (available after fees are sent)
    - **fees[].amount**: Calculated fee amount that will be credited
    
    Monitor the beneficiary wallet addresses to track fee receipts. The transaction hash provides proof of distribution on-chain.
  </Accordion>
