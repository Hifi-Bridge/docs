All requests to the HIFI API must be authenticated using API keys. This guide will walk you through the process of creating your API keys and using them to authenticate requests to our endpoints.

## Dashboard Access

Before you can create API keys, you'll need access to the HIFI Dashboard. Schedule a call with our team to discuss your use case and get access.

## Creating API Keys

After gaining Dashboard access, follow these steps to create your API keys:

### Step 1: Access the API Keys Section

1. Log in to the [HIFI Dashboard](https://dashboard.hifibridge.com)
2. Navigate to **Developer** â†’ **API Keys** or go directly to [https://dashboard.hifibridge.com/developer/apiKeys](https://dashboard.hifibridge.com/developer/apiKeys)

### Step 2: Create a New API Key

1. Click **"Create API Key"** or **"New API Key"**
2. Provide a descriptive name for your API key (e.g., "Production App", "Development Testing")
3. Select the appropriate permissions for your use case
4. Click **"Generate"** or **"Create"**

### Step 3: Copy Your API Key

<Info>
  **Important**: API keys are only shown once during creation. Make sure to copy
  and securely store your API key immediately.
</Info>

1. Copy the generated API key from the dashboard
2. Store it securely in your application's environment variables or secure key management system
3. Never commit API keys to version control or share them in public repositories

## Using API Keys

Include your API key in every request using the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://production.hifibridge.com/v2/users" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues with authentication:

1. Verify your API key is correct and active in the dashboard
2. Check that you're using the correct header format: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY`
3. Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions for the endpoint
4. Contact support if problems persist
