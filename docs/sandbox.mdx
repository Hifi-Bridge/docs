HIFI's sandbox environment provides a safe testing space to integrate and test our APIs without real charges or affecting production systems. All transactions, tokens, and balances in the sandbox are simulated and hold no real-world value.

## Getting Started

### Generate a Sandbox API Key

1. **Request Access** - Visit [dashboard.hifi.com/request-access](https://dashboard.hifi.com/request-access) to schedule a call with our team and get onboarded.
2. **Navigate to API Keys** - Once approved, go to the Developer Dashboard
3. **Create New Key** - Click the "New API Key" button under Sandbox

<Warning>
  Keep your sandbox API key secure and never commit it to version control. Use
  environment variables to store API keys in your applications.
</Warning>

### Sandbox Base URL

All sandbox API requests should be made to:

```
https://sandbox.hifi.com/v2/
```

**Example request:**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://sandbox.hifi.com/v2/ping" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SANDBOX_API_KEY"
```

## Sandbox vs Production

The sandbox environment is designed to simulate production behavior while providing a safe testing environment:

| Feature            | Sandbox                    | Production                        |
| :----------------- | :------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| **API Base URL**   | `https://sandbox.hifi.com` | `https://production.hifi.com`     |
| **Money Movement** | Simulated                  | Real                              |
| **KYC Processing** | Auto-approved              | Manual review (1-3 business days) |
| **Blockchain**     | Testnet                    | Mainnet                           |
| **Tokens**         | No real value              | Real cryptocurrency               |

### Automated KYC Approval

In sandbox, the KYC process is streamlined for testing:

- **Instant Approval** - KYC submissions are approved within a minute
- **No Real Verification** - No actual identity verification occurs
- **Dummy Data** - Use any test personal information and documents

<Info>
  In production, KYC applications undergo real compliance review and typically
  take 1-3 business days to process.
</Info>

### Simulated Transactions

All money movement in sandbox is simulated:

- **Virtual Deposits** - Use an endpoint to mimic bank deposits
- **Instant Processing** - Transfers complete immediately for testing
- **No Real Funds** - No actual money or cryptocurrency moves
- **Testnet Wallets** - All wallet addresses are on blockchain testnets

## Transitioning to Production

When you're ready to move from sandbox to production:

1. **Generate production API keys** in the dashboard
2. **Update your base URL** from `sandbox.hifi.com` to `production.hifi.com`
3. **Update API keys** in your environment variables
4. **Remove simulation calls** - Delete any simulate-deposit endpoint usage
5. **Enable real KYC** - Provide real user information and documents
6. **Test thoroughly** - Start with small transactions before scaling

<Warning>
  Never use sandbox API keys in production or production keys in sandbox. They
  are environment-specific and won't work cross-environment.
</Warning>
