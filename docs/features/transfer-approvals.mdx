**Transfer Approvals** introduce a maker–checker workflow ("Four Eyes Principle") to on-chain transfers, ensuring that any transfer initiated by one user must be explicitly approved by another authorized user before it is executed.

<Info>
This feature applies only to on-chain stablecoin transfers (wallet transfers, batch transfers, and bridging). Onramp and offramp transactions are not included.
</Info>

## How Transfer Approvals Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initiate transfer">
    Create a transfer with `requireApproval: true` to enter the approval workflow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Await approval">
    The transfer remains in a pending state until an authorized approver reviews and approves it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve or reject">
    An authorized user (typically an Admin) reviews and either approves or rejects the transfer request.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transfer executes">
    If approved, the transfer proceeds normally. If rejected, the transfer is cancelled.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Implementation Options

Transfer approvals work differently depending on where transfers are initiated:

### Dashboard Approvals

When using the HIFI Dashboard:

- **Members** can initiate wallet transfers (onramp/offramp restricted to Admins)
- **Member transfers** require Admin approval before execution
- **Email notifications** are sent for approvals/rejections
- **Admin transfers** execute without approval

### API Approvals

When using the API, include the `requireApproval` parameter when creating transfers. If set to `true`, the transfer will enter the approval workflow until it is approved or rejected.

## Creating Transfers with Approval

Include the `requireApproval` parameter when creating transfers to require approval before execution.

### Request

```bash
curl -X POST "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/wallets/transfers" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "currency": "usdc",
    "amount": 100,
    "chain": "POLYGON",
    "source": {
      "userId": "7d54a7a7-dac3-4313-8b09-27fa4b7fd1ee"
    },
    "destination": {
      "userId": "12c1c496-8f57-41a1-8292-dbe6547791ce"
    },
    "requireApproval": true
  }'
```

**Request Fields:**

- **requireApproval** (optional): Set to `true` to require approval before execution. Defaults to `false`, so existing integrations are unaffected.

**Standard Transfer Fields:**

- **currency** (required): Stablecoin currency code (e.g., `usdc`)
- **amount** (required): Transfer amount
- **chain** (required): Blockchain network (e.g., `POLYGON`, `ETHEREUM`, `BASE`)
- **source** (required): Source wallet details including userId
- **destination** (required): Destination wallet details including userId

### Supported Endpoints

The `requireApproval` parameter is supported on:

- `POST /v2/wallets/transfers` – Stablecoin to stablecoin transfers
- `POST /v2/wallets/transfers/batches` – Stablecoin batch transfers
- `POST /v2/wallets/bridges` – Stablecoin bridging transfers

<Info>
Because bridging is quote-based, quotes are only generated after approval. This ensures that they do not expire while waiting for review.
</Info>

## Transfer Status

When a transfer requires approval, it enters a pending state:

- **PENDING_APPROVAL**: Transfer is awaiting approval
- **APPROVED**: Transfer was approved and will proceed
- **REJECTED**: Transfer was rejected and will not execute

Check the transfer status using the [Retrieve Transfer](/api-reference/wallet/retrieve-transfer) endpoint to monitor approval status.

## Notifications

### Email Notifications

- **Admins** receive email notifications when a transfer is pending approval
- **Members** receive email notifications when their transfer request is approved or rejected

### Webhook Events

If your organization has enabled webhooks, you can listen for transfer approval events:

- `TRANSFER.APPROVAL.PENDING` - Request for approval
- `TRANSFER.APPROVAL.APPROVED` - Transfer was approved
- `TRANSFER.APPROVAL.REJECTED` - Transfer was rejected

Subscribe to these events to automate your approval workflow and update your system when approvals are processed.

## Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Approval Workflow">
    Transfer approvals follow a simple workflow:
    
    1. **Transfer created** with `requireApproval: true`
    2. **Status changes** to `PENDING_APPROVAL`
    3. **Approver notified** via email (or webhook)
    4. **Approver reviews** the transfer in Dashboard
    5. **Transfer approved or rejected** by authorized user
    6. **Transfer executes** (if approved) or is cancelled (if rejected)
    
    Transfers without `requireApproval` or set to `false` execute immediately without approval.
  </Accordion>

  {" "}

  <Accordion title="Approval Permissions">
    Only authorized users can approve transfers:
    
    - **Dashboard:** Admins can approve Member-initiated transfers
    - **API:** Users with appropriate permissions can approve transfers via the approval endpoints
    
    Member transfers require Admin approval. Admin transfers execute without approval.
  </Accordion>

  {" "}

  <Accordion title="Quote-Based Transfers">
    For bridging transfers (which are quote-based), quotes are generated **after** approval:
    
    - Prevents quote expiration while waiting for approval
    - Ensures the quote reflects current market conditions
    - User must wait for both approval and quote generation
    
    Other transfer types proceed immediately after approval.
  </Accordion>

  {" "}

  <Accordion title="Approval Timing">
    Consider approval timing in your workflows:
    
    - **Pending state**: Transfers remain in `PENDING_APPROVAL` until reviewed
    - **No timeout**: Approvals don't automatically expire (but quotes do if applicable)
    - **Manual action required**: Approvals must be explicitly approved or rejected
    
    Implement monitoring to ensure transfers don't remain pending indefinitely.
  </Accordion>

  {" "}

  <Accordion title="Conditional Approvals">
    You can implement conditional approval logic:
    
    - **High-value transfers**: Require approval for amounts above a threshold
    - **External wallets**: Require approval for transfers to new or external wallets
    - **Risk-based**: Require approval based on transaction patterns
    
    The `requireApproval` parameter gives you full control over when approvals are needed.
  </Accordion>

  {" "}

  <Accordion title="Batch Transfers">
    Batch transfers support approval workflows:
    
    - Set `requireApproval: true` when creating a batch
    - The entire batch requires approval before execution
    - If approved, all transfers in the batch proceed
    - If rejected, the entire batch is cancelled
    
    Individual batch transfers cannot be approved separately.
  </Accordion>
