title: "USDCx Bridging"
---

## Overview

USDCx bridging allows you to **move USDC issued by Circle between Ethereum and Canton** seamlessly. This functionality leverages **Circle's XReserve**, enabling fast, secure, and compliant movement of USDCx across chains while maintaining token integrity.

## Supported Bridging Actions

HIFI currently supports the following USDCx bridging functionalities:

- **Mint USDCx from Ethereum to Canton** – Lock USDC on Ethereum and mint USDCx in Canton.
- **Burn USDCx from Canton to Ethereum** – Burn USDCx in Canton and release USDC on Ethereum.

## How USDCx Bridging Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Bridging Request">
    The user initiates a bridging request from either Ethereum or Canton, specifying the amount and destination chain. A bridging quote is returned for review.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accept Bridging Quote">
    The user accepts the bridging quote to confirm the operation and proceed with the bridge.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bridge Processing">
    HIFI processes the bridging operation, validating the source transaction and preparing the destination chain transfer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mint or Release Tokens">
    Tokens are either minted on the destination chain (Canton) or released back on Ethereum, depending on the bridging direction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accept Transfer Offer on Canton">
    For bridges minting USDCx on Canton, a corresponding transfer offer is created. The user must accept the offer to receive USDCx in their Canton wallet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Completion">
    The user’s wallet balance is updated, and a bridging transaction hash is recorded for auditing and reference.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Mint USDCx to Canton

To mint USDCx on Canton, we will first use the [Create Bridge](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/bridge/create-a-bridge) endpoint to initiate a cross-chain transfer.

### Create Bridging Request

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/wallets/bridges" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \

### Accept Transfer Offer

Once the bridging transaction reaches the `COMPLETED` status, the `destination` object will include an `associatedCantonOffer` field.\
This field contains the corresponding Canton transfer offer that has been created and is ready to be accepted by the recipient wallet.

<Note>
  Only destination wallets within the HIFI system will have the `associatedCantonOffer` populated.
</Note>

**Example Completed Bridging Transaction**

```json {17}
{
  "transferType": "WALLET.BRIDGE",
  "transferDetails": {
    "id": "brg_abc123",
    "requestId": "1d860428-1d0b-47c5-9e65-98961ff59215",
    "createdAt": "2025-02-24T17:44:54.781519+00:00",
    "updatedAt": "2025-02-24T17:44:54.781519+00:00",
    "amount": 10,
    "status": "SOURCE_INITIATED",
    "source": {...},
    "destination": {
      "userId": "usr_abc123",
      "walletAddress": "HIFI-validator-1::1220e636b510224be2c15b4436c0eb72558fdd6a93268b3605fad7f27f58192910e6",

    },
    "receipt": {...},
    "quoteInformation": {...}
  }
}
```

You can use the `walletId` under the `destination` object and the `offerId` from the `associatedCantonOffer` to accept the offer:

```shellscript
curl -X POST "https://api.hifibridge.com/v2/wallets/<walletId>/offers/<offerId>/accept" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
