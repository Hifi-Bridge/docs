## What is Canton

Canton is a privacy-enabled, interoperable blockchain network designed for regulated financial use cases. It allows institutions to operate on a shared ledger while maintaining strict data privacy, governance controls, and compliance boundaries.

Unlike traditional public blockchains, Canton enables **selective data sharing**—participants only see the data they are entitled to—making it well-suited for enterprise, financial, and institutional workflows.

Canton supports asset issuance, settlement, and programmable workflows while integrating seamlessly with existing financial systems.

## Key Features of Canton

### Privacy by Design

Canton enforces granular privacy controls at the protocol level. Transactions, balances, and smart contract state are only visible to authorized parties, enabling compliant multi-party workflows without exposing sensitive information.

### Interoperability

Canton is built to interoperate with other networks and systems, allowing assets and workflows to extend beyond a single ledger while preserving security and privacy guarantees.

### Institutional-Grade Governance

The network supports fine-grained permissioning, identity controls, and governance models that align with regulated financial environments.

### Programmable Workflows

Canton enables smart contract–based logic for asset transfers, settlements, and conditional workflows, allowing complex financial interactions to be automated and enforced on-chain.

## Why Use Canton

- Designed for **regulated and institutional use cases**
- Enables **private, compliant asset movement**
- Supports **cross-network asset interoperability**
- Reduces operational risk through **deterministic settlement and programmable logic**

Canton bridges the gap between traditional financial infrastructure and blockchain-based systems.
