## What Is a Transfer Offer?

On Canton, asset transfers are modeled as **transfer offers** rather than immediate, unilateral transactions like those found on most public blockchains.

A transfer offer represents a **two-step, consent-based transfer**:

1. The sender creates an offer specifying the recipient and amount.
2. The recipient explicitly **accepts or rejects** the offer.

This design enables privacy-preserving, compliant, and deterministic settlement between known parties—an important distinction from public blockchains where transactions are typically broadcast and finalized immediately.

## Transfer Offer Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sender creates a transfer offer">
    The sender creates a transfer offer specifying the recipient Canton wallet, token, and amount. The specified amount of the asset is locked and cannot be used while the offer is pending.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Offer is received by destination wallet">
    The transfer offer becomes visible to the recipient’s Canton wallet
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accept or reject the offer">
    The recipient explicitly accepts or rejects the offer. Accepting executes the transfer, while rejecting declines it with no asset movement.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create Transfer Offer

A transfer offer is created by the sender to propose transferring a specified amount of token to a Canton wallet. The offer remains pending until the recipient takes action.

Creating a transfer offer utilizes the existing on-chain transfer functionality. For more details please checkout [Creating Single Transfers](https://docs.hifibridge.com/transactions/transfers#creating-single-transfers)

<Note>
  The transaction remains in a **PENDING** state until the recipient accepts or rejects the transfer offer.
</Note>

}
```

### Webhook Notifications

HIFI sends webhook events to notify your system of transfer offer state changes.

- Event format: `WALLET.OFFER.{status}`
- `{status}` will be one of: `RECEIVED`, `PENDING`, `ACCEPTED`, `REJECTED`
- The webhook payload uses the **same schema as the GET transfer offer endpoint**

<Note>
  Listen to the `WALLET.OFFER.RECEIVED` webhook events to be notified whenever a new incoming transfer offer is available for action.
</Note>

## Action Transfer Offer

Once a transfer offer has been received, the recipient can **accept or reject** the offer. The choice determines whether the asset will be credited into recipient's wallet or not.

<Note>
  A transfer offer must be **accepted or rejected** by the recipient before it expires. Once the expiration time passes, the offer is no longer valid.
</Note>

### Accept a Transfer Offer

Accepting a transfer offer executes the asset transfer and finalizes the transaction.

- The transfer moves the locked asset to the recipient’s wallet.
- The offer status will terminiate at `ACCEPTED`.

**Request**

```shellscript
curl -X POST "https://api.hifibridge.com/v2/wallets/<walletId>/offers/<offerId>/accept" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Offer Statuses

Each Canton transfer offer has a `status` that reflects its current state:

| Status     | Description                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RECEIVED` | The offer has been received by the destination wallet and is ready to be acted upon.                             |
| `PENDING`  | The offer is currently in the process of being accepted or rejected.                                             |
| `ACCEPTED` | The recipient has accepted the offer. The transfer has been executed and the asset has been moved.               |
| `REJECTED` | The recipient has rejected the offer. No transfer occurred, and the locked asset has been released back to the sender. |
