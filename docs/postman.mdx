## Getting Started

### Fork the Collection

To get started, fork [HIFI Developers](https://www.postman.com/winter-meteor-365174/workspace/hifi-developers/collection/36482019-965415fa-8dd5-4d2c-a4ca-068478dce9d9) collection. You should also fork the environment template to follow along with the guide.

### Set Your API Key

To run requests, provide your sandbox API key by setting it as the `api_key` environment variable in the HIFI Environment Template in your Postman workspace. Save your changes, activate the environment, and make sure your collection is set to use the HIFI Environment Template.

If your environment is set up correctly, you should see your API key value if you mouse over the `api_key` variable in the Token field.

<Warning>
  Use your **sandbox API key** for testing. Never share your API keys or commit
  them to version control.
</Warning>
