## Getting Started

### Fork the Collection

To get started, fork the collection from HIFI's public workspace within Postman.

1. Click the card above to open the HIFI Developers workspace
2. Click **"Fork Collection"**
3. Enter a name for your fork and select the workspace where it will be created
4. Click **"Fork Collection"**

You should also fork the environment template from the HIFI Developers Workspace if you want to follow along the guide.

### Set Your API Key

To run requests, you'll need to supply your sandbox API key and set it as an environment variable in the HIFI Environment Template within your workspace.

1. Add your API key under the `api_key` environment variable
2. Click **"Save"**
3. Set the environment to active by selecting it from the environment dropdown
4. Within the collection, set it to use the HIFI Environment Template

If your environment is set up correctly, you should see your API key value if you mouse over the `api_key` variable in the Token field.

<Warning>
  Use your **sandbox API key** for testing. Never share your API keys or commit
  them to version control.
</Warning>
