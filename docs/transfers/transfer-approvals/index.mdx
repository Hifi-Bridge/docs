title: "Transfer Approvals"
---

This feature introduces a maker–checker workflow ("Four Eyes Principle") to on-chain transfers, ensuring that any transfer initiated by one user must be explicitly approved by another authorized user before it is executed.

<Note>
  This release applies only to on-chain crypto transfers (wallet transfers,
  batch transfers, and bridging).
</Note>

## How it works

### Dashboard

- Members can now initiate wallet transfers. Onramp or offramp transfers are still restricted to Admins.
- At least one Admin approval is required for wallet transfers initiated by a Member before execution.
- Members and Admins are notified by email when a transfer request is approved or rejected.
- Admins retain their existing permissions. Transfers they create continue to execute without requiring approval.

### API

A new parameter `requireApproval` can be included when creating transfers. If set to `true`, the transfer will enter the approval workflow until it is approved or rejected.

The parameter defaults to `false`, so existing integrations are unaffected. This gives you the flexibility to define your own rules for when Admin approval is required.

**Supported endpoints:**

- `POST /wallets/transfers` – crypto to crypto
- `POST /wallets/transfers/batches` – crypto batch
- `POST /wallets/bridges` – crypto bridging

<Note>
  {" "}
  Bridging Because bridging is quote based, quotes are only generated after approval.
  This ensures that they do not expire while waiting for review.
</Note>

## Notifications

- Admins receive email notifications when a transfer is pending approval.
- Members receive email notifications when their transfer request is approved or rejected.

If your organization has enabled webhooks, you can also listen for transfer approval events:

- `TRANSFER.APPROVAL.PENDING` - Request for approval
- `TRANSFER.APPROVAL.APPROVED` - Transfer was approved
- `TRANSFER.APPROVAL.REJECTED` - Transfer was rejected
