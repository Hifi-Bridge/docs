title: "Bridging"
---

Bridging allows you to transfer stablecoins across different blockchain networks. This enables you to move assets from one chain to another, such as transferring USDC from Ethereum to Polygon or Solana.

## How Bridging Works

Bridging follows a simple three-step process:

1. **Create a bridge** – Initiate a bridge request with your source and destination chains
2. **Review quote** – Examine the transfer fees, estimated time, and quote validity period
3. **Accept bridge** – Confirm the transaction to execute the cross-chain transfer

### Quote Validity

Quotes are time-sensitive and typically expire within 24 hours. This ensures you get current network conditions and prevents stale pricing. If a quote expires before you accept it, you'll need to create a new bridge request to get updated information.

## Transaction Structure

When you create a bridge, the API response includes detailed information about the transaction:

## Transaction Status

Bridge transactions progress through several statuses:

- **CREATED**: Bridge request has been created and is awaiting processing
- **PROCESSING**: Cross-chain operations are being executed
- **COMPLETED**: Assets have been successfully transferred to the destination chain
- **FAILED**: Bridge failed (check `failedReason` for details)

## Quote Information

The quote includes both gross and net amounts for both sending and receiving:

- **sendGross**: Total amount you're sending from the source chain
- **sendNet**: Net amount after any rail fees are deducted
- **receiveGross**: Total amount you'll receive on the destination chain
- **receiveNet**: Net amount you'll actually receive
- **rate**: Exchange rate between the currencies (typically 1:1 for same-asset bridges)
- **expiresAt**: When the quote expires and you'll need a new one

## Bridging Operations

Bridging involves several blockchain operations that are tracked in the response:

- **Mint** – Creates new tokens on the destination chain
- **Burn** – Destroys tokens on the source chain
- **Approve** – Authorizes the bridge contract to spend your tokens

Each operation includes transaction hashes and user operation hashes for complete traceability across both chains.

<Info>
  Bridge operations may take several minutes to complete depending on network
  congestion and the specific chains involved. You can track the progress using
  the transaction hashes provided in the operations object.
