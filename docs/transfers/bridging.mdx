Bridging allows you to transfer cryptocurrencies across different blockchain networks. This enables you to move assets from one chain to another, such as transferring USDC from Ethereum to Polygon or Solana.

## Supported Bridges

Currently, we support bridging between the following networks:

- **Ethereum ↔ Polygon** for USDC and USDT
- **Ethereum ↔ Solana** for USDC and USDT
- **Polygon ↔ Solana** for USDC and USDT

## How Bridging Works

Bridging follows a simple three-step process:

1. **Create a bridge** – Initiate a bridge request with your source and destination chains
2. **Review quote** – Examine the transfer fees, estimated time, and quote validity period
3. **Accept bridge** – Confirm the transaction to execute the cross-chain transfer

### Quote Validity

Quotes are time-sensitive and typically expire within 24 hours. This ensures you get current network conditions and prevents stale pricing. If a quote expires before you accept it, you'll need to create a new bridge request to get updated information.

## Transaction Structure

When you create a bridge, the API response includes detailed information about the transaction:

## Transaction Status

Bridge transactions progress through several statuses:

- **CREATED**: Bridge request has been created and is awaiting processing
- **PROCESSING**: Cross-chain operations are being executed
- **COMPLETED**: Assets have been successfully transferred to the destination chain
- **FAILED**: Bridge failed (check `failedReason` for details)

## Quote Information

The quote includes both gross and net amounts for both sending and receiving:

- **sendGross**: Total amount you're sending from the source chain
- **sendNet**: Net amount after any rail fees are deducted
- **receiveGross**: Total amount you'll receive on the destination chain
- **receiveNet**: Net amount you'll actually receive
- **rate**: Exchange rate between the currencies (typically 1:1 for same-asset bridges)
- **expiresAt**: When the quote expires and you'll need a new one

## Bridging Operations

Bridging involves several blockchain operations that are tracked in the response:

- **Mint** – Creates new tokens on the destination chain
- **Burn** – Destroys tokens on the source chain
- **Approve** – Authorizes the bridge contract to spend your tokens

Each operation includes transaction hashes and user operation hashes for complete traceability across both chains.

### Operation Details

The `operations` object in the receipt contains detailed information about each blockchain operation:

- **transactionHash**: The blockchain transaction hash for the operation
- **userOpHash**: The user operation hash (for account abstraction wallets)
- **chain**: The blockchain network where the operation occurred

## Fees

Bridging includes network fees and processing fees that are clearly displayed in the quote. The fee structure varies by source and destination chains and is calculated based on current network conditions.

### Fee Structure

- **Rail fees**: Fees charged for the cross-chain transfer service
- **Network fees**: Gas fees for blockchain transactions
- **Timing**: Fees are typically included in the quote and deducted from the final amount

## Receipt Information

The `receipt` object contains transaction details once completed:

- **transactionHash**: Main transaction hash for the bridge operation
- **operations**: Detailed breakdown of all blockchain operations performed

<Note>
  Bridge operations may take several minutes to complete depending on network
  congestion and the specific chains involved. You can track the progress using
  the transaction hashes provided in the operations object.
