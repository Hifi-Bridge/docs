Wallet transfers allow you to send stablecoins directly between wallets on the same blockchain network.

## How Wallet Transfers Work

HIFI supports single and batch wallet transfers.

### Single Transfers

Send stablecoins to a single wallet address:

1. **Create a transfer** – Specify source wallet, destination wallet, and amount
2. **Transaction processing** – The transfer is executed on-chain
3. **Confirmation** – Receive transaction hash once completed

### Batch Transfers

Send stablecoins to multiple recipients in a single transaction:

1. **Create a batch** – Specify source wallet and up to 50 destination wallets with amounts
2. **Transaction processing** – All transfers are executed in a single on-chain transaction
3. **Confirmation** – Receive transaction hash for the entire batch

<Info>
  Batch transfers are more gas-efficient than sending individual transactions to
  multiple recipients. You can send to up to 50 recipients in a single batch.

## Batch Transfer Structure

When you create a batch wallet transfer, the API response includes detailed information about the transaction:

```json
{
  "transferType": "WALLET.TRANSFER.BATCH",
  "transferDetails": {
    "id": "879af7af-67bf-469f-b718-d262a39d4857",

```

## Transaction Status

Wallet transfers progress through several statuses:

- **`NOT_INITIATED`**: The transfer was not submitted due to a validation error
- **`CREATED`**: Transfer request has been created and is awaiting processing
- **`INITIATED`**: Transfer has been submitted to the blockchain
- **`PENDING`**: Transaction is awaiting on-chain confirmation
- **`COMPLETED`**: Transfer has been successfully confirmed on-chain
- **`FAILED`**: Transfer failed (check error details for more information)
- **`UNKNOWN`**: Transfer status could not be determined

## Approval Workflow

Batch transfers can optionally require approval before processing. This is useful for organizations that need multi-party authorization for large or sensitive transfers.

### How Approvals Work

When creating a batch transfer with `requireApproval: true`:

1. The transfer enters a `PENDING_APPROVAL` state
2. Designated approvers can review and vote on the transfer
3. Once approval threshold is met, the transfer proceeds
4. If rejected, the transfer is cancelled

### Approval Response

When approval is required, the receipt includes approval details:

```json
{
  "receipt": {
    "approval": {
      "id": "006737ca-42d5-4780-b3c2-aeb63279c591",
      "status": "PENDING",
      "createdAt": "2025-02-03T16:11:36.654998+00:00",
      "updatedAt": "2025-02-03T16:12:41.503+00:00",
      "transferId": "006737ca-42d5-4780-b3c2-aeb63279c591",
      "transferType": "WALLET.TRANSFER.BATCH",
      "fromDashboard": true,
      "initiatorProfileId": "aec66b02-4f3f-471c-839a-94820b36abb2",
      "votes": [
        {
          "approverId": "aec66b02-4f3f-471c-839a-94820b36abb2",
          "vote": "APPROVE",
          "comment": "Approved for processing",
          "createdAt": "2025-02-03T16:12:41.503+00:00"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
