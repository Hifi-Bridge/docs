title: "Transfer Approvals"
---

This feature introduces a maker–checker workflow ("Four Eyes Principle") to on-chain transfers, ensuring that any transfer initiated by one User must be explicitly approved by another authorized User before it is executed.

<Info>
  This release applies only to on-chain stablecoin transfers (wallet transfers,
  batch transfers, and bridging).
</Info>

## How Transfer Approvals work

### Approvals on Dashboard

- Members can initiate wallet transfers (onramp/offramp restricted to Admins)
- Member transfers require Admin approval before execution
- Email notifications sent for approvals/rejections
- Admin transfers execute without approval

### Approvals on API

A new parameter `requireApproval` can be included when creating transfers. If set to `true`, the transfer will enter the approval workflow until it is approved or rejected.

### Create Transfer with Approval

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://production.hifibridge.com/v2/wallets/transfers \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '{
  "currency": "usdc",
  "amount": 100,
  "chain": "POLYGON",
  "source": {
    "userId": "user-id"
  },
  "destination": {
    "userId": "user-id"
  },
  "requireApproval": true
}'
```

The parameter defaults to `false`, so existing integrations are unaffected. This gives you the flexibility to define your own rules for when Admin approval is required.

### Endpoints

- `POST /wallets/transfers` – stablecoin to stablecoin
- `POST /wallets/transfers/batches` – stablecoin batch
- `POST /wallets/bridges` – stablecoin bridging

<Info>
  {" "}
  Because bridging is quote based, quotes are only generated after approval. This
  ensures that they do not expire while waiting for review.
</Info>

## Notifications

- Admins receive email notifications when a transfer is pending approval.
- Members receive email notifications when their transfer request is approved or rejected.

### Webhooks

If your organization has enabled webhooks, you can also listen for transfer approval events:

- `TRANSFER.APPROVAL.PENDING` - Request for approval
- `TRANSFER.APPROVAL.APPROVED` - Transfer was approved
- `TRANSFER.APPROVAL.REJECTED` - Transfer was rejected
