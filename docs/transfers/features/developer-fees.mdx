title: "Developer Fees"
---

Developer fees enable automated calculation and distribution of fees for offramp transactions. Two fee models are supported: **percentage fees** and **flat fees**. Fees can be configured to be distributed to up to **10 different beneficiary wallets**.

## How Developer Fees Work

1. **Define fees and beneficiary** – Specify the fee calculation method and destination wallets by including the developer fee when creating offramp transactions.
3. **Automatic distribution** – Fees are automatically calculated and distributed during the offramp process

## Fee Calculation and Logic

**HIFI currently supports two types of fee models:**

- **Percentage:** The fee is calculated based on the amount being converted into fiat.
- **Flat:** The fee is charged as a fixed amount, regardless of the amount being converted into fiat.

**All fees are added on top of the offramp amount and credited to the beneficiary wallet in stablecoin.**

**Example:**

An offramp transaction with an amount of **100 USDC** and two developer fees:

- **20 bps (0.002)** as a percentage, credited to **Beneficiary Wallet A**
- **5 USDC** as a flat fee, credited to **Beneficiary Wallet B**

When the offramp transaction is initiated, a total of **105.2 USDC** (100 + 100 × 0.002 + 5) will be debited from the sender’s wallet. After settlement:

- **100 USDC** will be converted into fiat and sent to the recipient’s bank account
- **0.2 USDC** will be delivered to **Wallet A**
- **5 USDC** will be delivered to **Wallet B**
