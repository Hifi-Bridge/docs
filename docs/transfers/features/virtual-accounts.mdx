title: "Virtual Accounts"
---

The Virtual Accounts API allows you to create dedicated bank accounts for converting fiat currency to stablecoins. These accounts can be reused for multiple transactions and provide better rates for recurring operations. You can settle funds to external wallets or internal wallet addresses.

## How Virtual Accounts Work

1. **Create virtual account** â€“ Generate a dedicated bank account for fiat-to-stablecoin conversions
2. **Receive deposits** â€“ Accept fiat deposits through multiple payment rails (ACH, Wire, RTP, SWIFT)
3. **Convert automatically** â€“ Deposits are automatically converted to stablecoins and sent to a Wallet

### Account Configuration

Virtual accounts are configured per user and support multiple payment rails and destination currencies. You can create accounts for different blockchain networks and stablecoin types.

## Create Virtual Account

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://production.hifibridge.com/v2/users/userId/virtual-accounts \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '{
  "sourceCurrency": "usd",
  "destinationCurrency": "usdc",
  "destinationChain": "POLYGON",
  "externalWalletId": "string"
}'
```

<Info>
  Either `destinationChain` or `externalWalletId` must be provided. If
  `externalWalletId` is specified, the system will use the associated wallet's
  chain and address. USDT is only supported on Ethereum.
