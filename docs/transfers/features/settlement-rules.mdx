Settlement rules allow you to configure how fees are calculated and distributed for Virtual Account transactions. You can set up complex fee structures with multiple rules, percentage-based or fixed fees, and tiered pricing models to optimize your revenue sharing strategy.

## How Settlement Rules Work

Settlement rules follow a simple two-step process:

1. **Create settlement rules** – Configure fee calculation and distribution rules for your Virtual Accounts
2. **Apply to Virtual Accounts** – Rules automatically apply to all transactions on configured Virtual Accounts

## Creating a Rule

```json
{
  "requestId": "1d860428-1d0b-47c5-9e65-98961ff59215",
  "chain": "POLYGON",
  "includeHIFIFee": true,
  "rules": [
    {
      "type": "PERCENTAGE",
      "calculationModel": "TIERED",
      "value": null,
      "tiers": [
        {
          "walletAddress": "0x1234...5678",
          "threshold": 1000,
          "percentage": 0.5
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rule Types

### Fixed Fee Rules

Fixed fee rules charge a constant amount regardless of transaction size. This is useful for covering base processing costs or minimum fees.

**Example**: $5.00 fee on every transaction

### Percentage Fee Rules

Percentage rules calculate fees as a percentage of the transaction amount. You can set either fixed percentages or tiered structures that offer volume discounts.

### Tiered Fee Rules

Tiered fee rules allow you to set different fee percentages based on transaction volume thresholds. This enables volume-based discounts and progressive fee structures.

**Example**: 3% fee for transactions up to $10,000, then 2% fee for amounts above $10,000

Key components of tiered rules:

- **Threshold**: The transaction amount where the tier begins
- **Percentage**: Fee percentage applied for amounts in that tier
- **Wallet Address**: Destination for fees collected in each tier
