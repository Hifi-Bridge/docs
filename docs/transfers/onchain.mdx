**Wallet transfers** allow you to send stablecoins between wallets on blockchain networks. Transfers can be sent to other HIFI users or external wallet addresses.

## Transfer Types

HIFI supports two types of wallet transfers:

| Type                | Description                                              | Best For                                    |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **Single Transfer** | Send to one recipient                                    | Individual payments, one-time transactions  |
| **Batch Transfer**  | Send to up to 50 recipients in a single transaction      | Payroll, airdrops, bulk distributions       |

## Creating Single Transfers

Send stablecoins to a single recipient on the same blockchain.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Transfer to HIFI User
curl -X POST "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/wallets/transfers" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source": {
      "userId": "usr_abc123"
    },
    "destination": {

    "amount": 10,
    "currency": "usdc",
    "chain": "POLYGON",
    "requestId": "a40ea2aa-7937-4be9-bb1f-b75f1489bcc6"

```

```bash Transfer to External Wallet
curl -X POST "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/wallets/transfers" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

    "destination": {

    "chain": "POLYGON",
    "requestId": "b51fb3bb-8a48-5cfa-cc2g-c86g2589cdd7"
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
**External Wallet Registration:** Before sending to external wallet addresses, you must register them using the [External Wallets API](/api-reference/wallet/add-external-wallets-to-a-user). Unregistered addresses will cause the transfer to fail.
</Warning>

The response contains the transfer details:

## Transaction Status

Wallet transfers progress through several statuses:

| Status              | Description                                                       |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NOT_INITIATED**   | Transfer not submitted due to validation error                    |
| **CREATED**         | Transfer request created and awaiting processing                  |
| **INITIATED**       | Transfer submitted to blockchain                                  |
| **PENDING**         | Transaction awaiting on-chain confirmation                        |
| **COMPLETED**       | Transfer successfully confirmed on-chain                          |
| **FAILED**          | Transfer failed (check `failedReason` for details)                |
| **UNKNOWN**         | Transfer status could not be determined                           |

## Tracking Transfers

<Note>
**Status Updates:** Subscribe to `WALLET.TRANSFER.UPDATE` webhook events to receive real-time status notifications. See [Webhooks](/docs/webhooks/wallet) for setup instructions.
</Note>

Monitor transfer status using the [Retrieve Crypto Transfer](/api-reference/crypto-transfer/retrieve-a-crypto-transfer) endpoint. The response structure matches the create endpoint shown above.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/wallets/transfers/xfr_abc123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Use the `transactionHash` in the response to view the transaction on a blockchain explorer like [Polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com/) or [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).

## Transfer Approvals

For organizations requiring multi-party authorization, all transfers support an optional approval workflow.

### How Approvals Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable approval requirement">
    Set `requireApproval: true` when creating a transfer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review pending transfer">
    The transfer enters `PENDING_APPROVAL` status. Dashboard admins are notified via email and webhook to approve or reject the transfer. Any admin can make the decision.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execution or rejection">
    If approved, the transfer is executed. If rejected, it's cancelled.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Request with approval:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/wallets/transfers/batch" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source": {
      "userId": "usr_abc123"
    },
    "destinations": [...],
    "currency": "usdc",
    "chain": "POLYGON",
    "requireApproval": true,
    "requestId": "c62gc4cc-9b59-6dgb-dd3h-d97h3690dee8"
  }'
```

When approval is required, the response includes approval details:

<Accordion title="Response">

```json
{
  "transferDetails": {
    "id": "bat_abc123",
    "status": "PENDING_APPROVAL",
    "receipt": {
      "approval": {
        "id": "apv_xyz789",
        "status": "PENDING",
        "transferId": "bat_abc123",
        "transferType": "WALLET.TRANSFER.BATCH",
        "votes": [
          {
            "approverId": "profile_abc123",
            "vote": "APPROVE",
            "comment": "Approved for processing",
            "createdAt": "2025-02-03T16:12:41.503+00:00"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</Accordion>

<ResponseField name="transferDetails.status" type="string">
  Transfer status. When `requireApproval: true` is set, the status will be `PENDING_APPROVAL` until approved.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="transferDetails.receipt.approval" type="object">
  Approval object containing approval details and votes when approval is required.

  <Expandable title="properties">
    <ResponseField name="id" type="string">
      Unique approval ID.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="status" type="string">
      Approval status: `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, or `REJECTED`.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="votes" type="array">
      Array of approval votes. Each vote contains `approverId`, `vote` (APPROVE/REJECT), optional `comment`, and `createdAt`.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<Note>
**Configuring Approvers:** Manage your team roles in the HIFI Dashboard. Members can create transfers, but only admins can approve.
</Note>

## Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="HIFI vs External Transfers">
    **HIFI transfers** use `userId` as the destination while **external transfers** use a `walletAddress` as the destination.
    
    <Warning>
    **Registration Required:** External wallet addresses must be registered before use. Create an external wallet record using the [External Wallets API](/api-reference/wallet/add-external-wallets-to-a-user) before including the address in transfer requests.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Batch Transfer Limits">
    Batch transfers have the following constraints:
    - **Maximum recipients:** 50 per batch
    - **Supported chains:** Currently POLYGON only
    - **Supported currencies:** USDC, USDT
    
    If you need to send to more than 50 recipients, create multiple batches.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transaction Receipts">
    The `receipt` object provides blockchain verification:
    - **transactionHash:** Unique identifier for the blockchain transaction. Use this to view the transaction on block explorers.
    - **userOpHash:** For account abstraction wallets, this is the user operation hash
    
    Both values are `null` until the transfer is confirmed on-chain (status becomes COMPLETED).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
