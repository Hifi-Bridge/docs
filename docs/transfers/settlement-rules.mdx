title: "Settlement Rules"
---

Settlement rules allow you to configure how fees are calculated and distributed for virtual account transactions. You can set up complex fee structures with multiple rules, percentage-based or fixed fees, and tiered pricing models to optimize your revenue sharing strategy.

## How it works

Settlement rules let you configure how fees are handled:

- **Calculate fees** using percentages or fixed amounts
- **Set tiered pricing** for volume discounts
- **Distribute fees** to multiple wallet addresses

## Key Features

- **Multiple Rule Types**: Combine percentage and fixed fee rules
- **Tiered Pricing**: Volume-based discounts with configurable tiers
- **Flexible Distribution**: Route fees to different wallet addresses
- **Network Support**: Configure rules for specific blockchain networks
- **Fee Management**: Control HIFI platform fee inclusion/exclusion

## Rule Types

### Percentage Rules

Percentage rules calculate fees as a percentage of the transaction amount. You can set either fixed percentages or tiered structures that offer volume discounts.

**Fixed Percentage**: A consistent percentage fee applied to all transactions
**Tiered Percentage**: Volume-based pricing with decreasing rates for larger transactions

### Fixed Rules

Fixed rules charge a constant fee regardless of transaction amount. This is useful for covering base processing costs or minimum fees.

### Combined Rules

You can combine multiple rule types to create complex fee structures. For example, a percentage fee plus a fixed processing fee.

## Supported Networks

| Network  | Chain ID | Native Currency |
| -------- | -------- | --------------- |
| Ethereum | ETHEREUM | ETH             |
| Polygon  | POLYGON  | MATIC           |
| Base     | BASE     | ETH             |
| Solana   | SOLANA   | SOL             |

## Fee Calculation Logic

### Percentage Fees

Percentage fees are calculated as: `Transaction Amount Ã— Fee Percentage`

For tiered pricing, the system evaluates each tier in order and applies the appropriate rate based on the transaction amount.

### Fixed Fees

Fixed fees are added as a constant amount regardless of transaction size.

### Combined Calculations

When multiple rules are applied, fees are calculated separately and then summed together.

## Use Cases

### E-commerce Platforms

Set percentage-based fees to cover payment processing costs while maintaining profitability.

### Trading Platforms

Implement tiered pricing to offer volume discounts to high-frequency traders.

### Financial Services

Use fixed fees for minimum transaction costs combined with percentage fees for revenue sharing.
