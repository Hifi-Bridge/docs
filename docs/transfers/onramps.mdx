---

Onramps are transactions that convert fiat currencies to stablecoins in HIFI wallets. The available onramp methods vary by region due to local payment infrastructure and regulatory requirements.

## How Onramps Work

Onramps follow a simple three-step process:

1. **Create an onramp** – Initiate a payment from an Account into a Wallet
2. **Review quote** – Examine the exchange rate, fees, and quote validity period
3. **Send money** – Transfer the fiat currency to the provided bank account using the reference ID

### Quote Validity

Quotes are time-sensitive and typically expire within 24 hours. This ensures you get current market rates and prevents stale pricing.

If a quote expires before you deposit funds, you'll need to create a new onramp request to get updated pricing.

## Transaction Structure

When you create an onramp, the API response includes detailed information about the transaction:
