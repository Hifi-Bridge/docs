## Quotes

After initiating an onramp transaction, you'll get a quote that specifies the exchange rate and fees. Quotes are valid for a limited time window and must be accepted before proceeding with the transaction.

### Getting a Quote

To get an onramp quote:

1. Specify the input currency (fiat) and amount
2. Specify the desired output stablecoin
3. Review the quote details:
   - Exchange rate
   - Network fees
   - Processing time
   - Quote expiration

### Accepting a Quote

Once you receive a quote:

1. Review all terms and fees
2. Accept the quote within the validity window (typically 30-60 seconds)
3. Proceed with the payment using your chosen method

If a quote expires before acceptance, you'll need to request a new quote with current market rates.
