title: "Offramps"
---

Offramps are transactions that convert stablecoins in HIFI wallets to fiat currencies. The available offramp methods vary by region due to local payment infrastructure and regulatory requirements.

## How Offramps Work

Offramps follow a simple three-step process:

1. **Create an offramp** – Initiate a payment from Wallet to Account
2. **Review quote** – Examine the exchange rate, fees, and quote validity period
3. **Accept quote** – The fiat currency is transferred to the Account

### Quote Validity

Quotes are time-sensitive and typically expire within 10 minutes. This ensures you get current market rates and prevents stale pricing. If a quote expires before you accept it, you'll need to create a new offramp request to get updated pricing.

## Supported Regions

The available offramp methods vary by region due to local payment infrastructure and regulatory requirements.

## Transaction Structure

When you create an offramp, the API response includes detailed information about the transaction:

## Transaction Status

Offramp transactions progress through several statuses:

- **CREATED**: Transaction has been created and is awaiting processing
- **PROCESSING**: Stablecoins are being converted and fiat transfer is being initiated
- **COMPLETED**: Fiat currency has been successfully transferred to your account
- **FAILED**: Transaction failed (check `failedReason` for details)

## Quote Information

The quote includes both gross and net amounts for both sending and receiving:

- **sendGross**: Total amount you're sending in stablecoins
- **sendNet**: Net amount after any fees are deducted
- **receiveGross**: Total amount you'll receive in fiat currency
- **receiveNet**: Net amount you'll actually receive
- **rate**: Current exchange rate between stablecoin and fiat
- **expiresAt**: When the quote expires and you'll need a new one

### Developer Fee Types

You can monetize offramp transactions by adding a developer fee. Developer fees can be configured in two ways:

- **FIX**: Fixed fee amount regardless of transaction size
- **PERCENT**: Percentage-based fee calculated on the transaction amount

## Receipt Information

The `receipt` object contains transaction details once completed:

- **transactionHash**: Blockchain transaction hash for the stablecoin transfer
- **uetr**: Unique End-to-end Transaction Reference for international wire transfers
