Offramps are transactions that convert stablecoins in HIFI wallets to fiat currencies. The available offramp methods vary by region due to local payment infrastructure and regulatory requirements.

## Supported Offramps

Currently, we support the following offramp methods:

- **ACH transfers** for USD conversions
- **Wire transfers** for larger amounts
- **Regional payment methods** based on your location

## How Offramps Work

Offramps follow a simple three-step process:

1. **Create an offramp** – Initiate an offramp request with your source stablecoin and destination fiat currency
2. **Review quote** – Examine the exchange rate, fees, and quote validity period
3. **Complete withdrawal** – The fiat currency will be transferred to your registered account

### Quote Validity

Quotes are time-sensitive and typically expire within 10 minutes. This ensures you get current market rates and prevents stale pricing. If a quote expires before you accept it, you'll need to create a new offramp request to get updated pricing.

## Regions

The available offramp methods vary by region due to local payment infrastructure and regulatory requirements. For detailed information about supported regions, payment methods, and currencies, see [Rails](/docs/fiat/rails).

## Currencies

### Fiat Currencies

- **Americas**: USD, BRL, MXN
- **Africa**: NGN, KES, XOF, RWF, TZS, ZMW, MWK, XAF, ZAR, BWP
- **Asia-Pacific**: USD (Hong Kong, China)

### Stablecoins

- USDC (Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Base)
- USDT (Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Base)

For a complete list of supported currencies and payment methods, see [Currencies](/docs/currencies).

## Transaction Structure

When you create an offramp, the API response includes detailed information about the transaction:

## Transaction Status

Offramp transactions progress through several statuses:

- **CREATED**: Transaction has been created and is awaiting processing
- **PROCESSING**: Stablecoins are being converted and fiat transfer is being initiated
- **COMPLETED**: Fiat currency has been successfully transferred to your account
- **FAILED**: Transaction failed (check `failedReason` for details)

## Quote Information

The quote includes both gross and net amounts for both sending and receiving:

- **sendGross**: Total amount you're sending in stablecoins
- **sendNet**: Net amount after any fees are deducted
- **receiveGross**: Total amount you'll receive in fiat currency
- **receiveNet**: Net amount you'll actually receive
- **rate**: Current exchange rate between stablecoin and fiat
- **expiresAt**: When the quote expires and you'll need a new one

## Fees

Offramps may include various fees that are clearly displayed in the quote information and developer fee structure:

### Fee Structure

- **Developer fees**: Fixed or percentage-based fees for using the service
- **Rail fees**: Fees charged by the payment rail (ACH, wire, etc.)
- **Exchange fees**: Fees for converting stablecoin to fiat (if applicable)
- **Timing**: Fees are typically included in the quote and deducted from the final amount

### Developer Fee Types

- **FIX**: Fixed fee amount regardless of transaction size
- **PERCENT**: Percentage-based fee calculated on the transaction amount

## Account Requirements

Before creating an offramp transaction, you need to set up an account:

1. **Create an account** – Register the fiat destination using the Accounts API
2. **Verify account details** – Ensure all account information is accurate
3. **Create offramp** – Initiate the offramp transaction with the account details

<Note>
  The account must be verified and active before you can create an offramp transaction. The account ID is required in the destination object when creating the offramp.
</Note>

## Receipt Information

The `receipt` object contains transaction details once completed:

- **transactionHash**: Blockchain transaction hash for the stablecoin transfer
- **uetr**: Unique End-to-end Transaction Reference for international wire transfers
