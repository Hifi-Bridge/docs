## Quotes

After initiating an offramp transaction, you'll get a quote that specifies the exchange rate and fees. Quotes are valid for a limited time window and must be accepted before proceeding with the transaction.

### Getting a Quote

To get an offramp quote:

1. Specify the input stablecoin and amount
2. Specify the desired output currency (fiat)
3. Review the quote details:
   - Exchange rate
   - Network fees
   - Processing time
   - Quote expiration

### Accepting a Quote

Once you receive a quote:

1. Review all terms and fees
2. Accept the quote within the validity window (typically 30-60 seconds)
3. Proceed with the withdrawal using your chosen method

If a quote expires before acceptance, you'll need to request a new quote with current market rates.

## Account Requirements

Before creating an offramp transaction, you need to set up an account:

1. **Create an account** – Register the fiat destination using the Accounts API
2. **Verify account details** – Ensure all account information is accurate
3. **Create offramp** – Initiate the offramp transaction with the account details
