title: "Swaps"
---

Swaps allow you to exchange one cryptocurrency for another within the same blockchain network. This is useful for converting between different stablecoins or other supported tokens without needing to bridge across chains.

## Supported Swaps

Currently, we support the following swap pairs:

- **USDC ↔ USDT** on Polygon, Ethereum and Solana networks

## How Swaps Work

Swaps follow a simple three-step process:

1. **Create a swap** – Initiate a swap request with source and destination
2. **Review quote** – Examine the exchange rate, fees, and quote validity period
3. **Accept swap** – Confirm the transaction to execute the swap

### Quote Validity

Quotes are time-sensitive and typically expire within 30-60 seconds. This ensures you get current market rates and prevents stale pricing. If a quote expires before you accept it, you'll need to create a new swap request to get updated pricing.

## Fees

Swaps include exchange fees that are clearly displayed in the quote and billing information. The fee structure is transparent and calculated based on current market conditions.

### Fee Structure

When you create a swap, the API response includes detailed billing information:

```json
{
  "billingInformation": {
    "fees": [
      {
        "id": "2ca381ec-9498-52f5-9a27-d0e392b2626b",
        "amount": 0.01,
        "currency": "USD",
        "type": "EXCHANGE_FEE",
        "timing": "ON_INVOICE"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Fee Types

- **EXCHANGE_FEE**: The fee charged for the currency exchange service
- **Timing**: Fees are typically charged "ON_INVOICE" meaning they're included in your monthly billing

### Quote Information

The quote includes both gross and net amounts for both sending and receiving:

- **sendGross**: Total amount you're sending (including any fees)
- **sendNet**: Net amount after fees are deducted
- **receiveGross**: Total amount you'll receive
- **receiveNet**: Net amount you'll actually receive
- **rate**: Current exchange rate between the currencies
