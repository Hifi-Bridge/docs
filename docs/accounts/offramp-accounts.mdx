title: "Offramp Accounts"
---

An **Offramp Account** is your user's external bank account where they receive fiat money after converting stablecoins. When users offramp, their stablecoins are converted to fiat and sent directly to this registered account.

## How Offramp Accounts Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the account">
    Register the user's external bank account with HIFI by providing account
    details and account holder information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create offramp">
    Initiate an offramp transfer request to get a conversion quote with current
    exchange rates and fees.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accept quote">
    Review and accept the quote to execute the conversion. Stablecoins are
    converted to fiat and delivered to the registered bank account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Each offramp account is configured for a specific currency and region (e.g., USD in the US, BRL in Brazil). You can create multiple offramp accounts per user for different currencies and regions.

## Creating Offramp Accounts

<Warning>
  **Rail Requirement:** Before you can create an offramp account, you must
  unlock the corresponding rail for the user. For example, to create a USD
  offramp account, the user must have an active USD rail. Complete KYC
  verification for the rail first using the [KYC process](/docs/users/kyc).
</Warning>

Create an offramp account using the [Create Account](/api-reference/account/create-an-account) endpoint.

### Supported Account Types

Offramp accounts support multiple rails and regions. Accounts are organized by rail:

## Using Offramp Accounts

Once an offramp account is created and active, users can initiate offramp transfers using the [Create Offramp](/api-reference/offramp/create-an-offramp) endpoint. The `accountId` from the account creation response is used as the destination.

**Example offramp request:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://sandbox.hifi.com/v2/offramps" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source": {
      "currency": "usdc",
      "chain": "POLYGON",
      "userId": "usr_abc123",
      "amount": 100
    },
    "destination": {
      "currency": "usd",
      "accountId": "583eb259-e78b-4f0c-a4b5-a8957876fa6f",
      "userId": "usr_abc123"
    },
    "requestId": "b08e27be-c086-4b84-a321-307ed9f265e1"
  }'
```

When the offramp completes, fiat funds are automatically sent to the registered bank account.

<Info>
  **Offramp Flow:** Learn more about the complete offramp process, including
  quote acceptance and status tracking, in the [Offramps
  documentation](/docs/transfers/offramps).
</Info>

## Account Validation

After creating an offramp account, HIFI validates the account details. The account status indicates whether validation passed:

- **`ACTIVE`** - Account is validated and ready to receive funds
- **`PENDING`** - Account is being validated
- **`REJECTED`** - Account validation failed (check `invalidFields` for details)

<Warning>
  **Account Holder Matching:** The account holder information must match the
  user's KYC information. Mismatches may cause the account to be rejected or
  offramp transfers to fail for compliance reasons.
</Warning>

## Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Multiple Accounts Per User">
    You can create multiple offramp accounts per user for different currencies, regions, or payment methods. Each account has a unique ID that you reference when creating offramp transfers.
    
    Example: A user might have:
    - One USD account for US wire transfers
    - One BRL account for Brazil PIX transfers
    - One MXN account for Mexico SPEI transfers
  </Accordion>

{" "}

{" "}

<Accordion title="Account Holder Information">
  Account holder information must match the user's KYC details. This includes: -
  Name (must match exactly) - Address (should match or be consistent) - ID
  information (for regions that require it) Discrepancies can cause validation
  failures or offramp rejections.
</Accordion>

{" "}

{" "}

<Accordion title="Account Types vs Transfer Types">
  - **Account Type** (`type` field): The region/country (e.g., `us`, `brazil`,
  `mexico`) - **Transfer Type** (`transferType` in account-specific fields): The
  payment method (e.g., `wire`, `ach`, `pix`, `spei`) Not all transfer types are
  available in all regions. Check the API reference for supported combinations.
</Accordion>

{" "}

  <Accordion title="Business vs Individual Accounts">
    Account holder `type` can be `individual` or `business`. Business accounts may require additional information like:
    - Formation date (for Global Network accounts)
    - Business registration number
    - Additional compliance documentation
    
    Ensure you provide all required fields based on the account holder type.
