## Notes & Caveats

- This coverage reflects available partners and channels from the referenced sheet. Institution naming follows the sheet verbatim; some entities may appear under both **Bank** and **Momo** where they operate across categories.
- WAEMU (**XOF**) and CEMAC (**XAF**) are predominantly mobile-money first. Country-specific availability (e.g., **TG** for Togo, **BJ** for Benin) is indicated where the source provided hints.
- For production integrations, confirm current coverage, limits, and KYC requirements with the Partnerships team.
