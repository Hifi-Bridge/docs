For USD rails, we provide detailed KYC information to help developers debug issues or request additional or updated information from end users in order to complete the KYC process.

Below are the possible statuses for a user’s KYC application:

- **ACTIVE**
- **INACTIVE**
- **REJECTED**
- **PENDING**
- **RFI_PENDING**
- **INCOMPLETE**
- **MANUAL_REVIEW**
- **CONTACT_SUPPORT**

We’ll go through each status in detail shortly. But first, let’s take a look at the structure of an individual KYC status response.
