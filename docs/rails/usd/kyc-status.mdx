For USD rails, we provide detailed KYC information to help developers debug issues or request additional or updated information from end users in order to complete the KYC process.

Below are the possible statuses for a user’s KYC application:

- **ACTIVE**
- **INACTIVE**
- **REJECTED**
- **PENDING**
- **RFI_PENDING**
- **INCOMPLETE**
- **MANUAL_REVIEW**
- **CONTACT_SUPPORT**

We’ll go through each status in detail shortly. But first, let’s take a look at the structure of an individual KYC status response.

## Response Overview

Below is an example response of an individual KYC status response

```json
{
    "status": "",
    "message": "",
    "reviewResult": {
        "reviewAnswer": "",
        "reviewRejectType": "",
        "rejectReasons": [],
        "comment": ""
    },
    "details": {
        "identity": {
			{
        		"reviewAnswer": "",
        		"reviewRejectType": "",
        		"rejectReasons": [],
        		"comment": ""
    		},
			"details": [
				...
			]
        },
        "questionnaire": {
            {
        		"reviewAnswer": "",
        		"reviewRejectType": "",
        		"rejectReasons": [],
        		"comment": ""
    		},
			"details": [
				...
			]
        },
        "personalInfo": {
            {
        		"reviewAnswer": "",
        		"reviewRejectType": "",
        		"rejectReasons": [],
        		"comment": ""
    		},
			"details": [
				...
			]
        },
		"proofOfAddress": {
			{
        		"reviewAnswer": "",
        		"reviewRejectType": "",
        		"rejectReasons": [],
        		"comment": ""
    		},
			"details": [
				...
			]
		}

    }
}
```

At the top level, the KYC status response consists of four main sections:

- **status** – The primary status of the KYC application, indicating its current progress.
- **message** – A human-readable message intended to provide additional context for developers.
- **reviewResult** – A more detailed screening outcome from our compliance engine, which can serve as a secondary reference for understanding a user’s KYC status.
- **details** – A comprehensive breakdown of the compliance categories and data points screened for the applicant.

Under the first level of the `details` there are four compliance categories that we screen against the individual KYC

- idnetity - This section indicate the screening result of the ID documentation
- questionnaire - This section indicate the screening result of the source of funds expected use questionnaire
- personalInfo - This scetion is for the non-doc information the user provided, for example first name, last name, address ...etc
- proofOfAddress - This section indicate the screening result of the PoA documentation if provided during the KYC application
