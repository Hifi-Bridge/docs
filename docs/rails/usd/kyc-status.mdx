title: "Understanding the KYC Status Response"
description: "This section provides guidance on how to correctly interpret the KYC status response. It explains the structure of the response object, the meaning of each field, and how to use this information to manage and troubleshoot user KYC applications effectively."

For USD rails, we provide detailed KYC information to help developers debug issues or request additional or updated information from end users in order to complete the KYC process.

Below are the possible statuses for a user’s KYC application:

- **ACTIVE**
- **INACTIVE**
- **REJECTED**
- **PENDING**
- **RFI_PENDING**
- **INCOMPLETE**
- **MANUAL_REVIEW**
- **CONTACT_SUPPORT**

We’ll go through each status in detail shortly. But first, let’s take a look at the structure of an individual KYC status response.

## Response Overview

Below is an example of an individual KYC status response:

```json expandable
{
    "status": "",
    "message": "",
    "reviewResult": {
        "reviewAnswer": "",
        "reviewRejectType": "",
        "rejectReasons": [],
        "comment": ""
    },
    "details": {
        "identity": {
			{
        		"reviewAnswer": "",
        		"reviewRejectType": "",
        		"rejectReasons": [],
        		"comment": ""
    		},
			"details": [
				...
			]
        },
        "questionnaire": {
            {
        		"reviewAnswer": "",
        		"reviewRejectType": "",
        		"rejectReasons": [],
        		"comment": ""
    		},
			"details": [
				...
			]
        },
        "personalInfo": {
            {
        		"reviewAnswer": "",
        		"reviewRejectType": "",
        		"rejectReasons": [],
        		"comment": ""
    		},
			"details": [
				...
			]
        },
		"proofOfAddress": {
			{
        		"reviewAnswer": "",
        		"reviewRejectType": "",
        		"rejectReasons": [],
        		"comment": ""
    		},
			"details": [
				...
			]
		}

    }
}
```

At the top level, the KYC status response consists of four main sections:

- **status** – The primary status of the KYC application, indicating its current progress.
- **message** – A human-readable message intended to provide additional context for developers.
- **reviewResult** – A more detailed screening outcome from our compliance engine, which can serve as a secondary reference for understanding a user’s KYC status.
- **details** – A comprehensive breakdown of the compliance categories and data points screened for the applicant.

Under the `details` section, there are four compliance categories that we screen against each individual KYC applicant:

- **identity** – Indicates the screening result of the user’s ID documentation.
- **questionnaire** – Indicates the screening result of the “source of funds and intended use” questionnaire.
- **personalInfo** – Contains the results based on non-document information provided by the user, such as first name, last name, and address.
- **proofOfAddress** – Indicates the screening result of the proof of address (PoA) documentation, if provided during the KYC application.

Let’s also take a look at the `reviewResult` object, which appears both at the top level and within each compliance category.

- **reviewAnswer** – Indicates the outcome of the screening. Possible values are `APPROVED` and `DECLINED`.
- **reviewRejectType** – Indicates whether resubmission is allowed. Possible values are `FINAL` and `RETRY`. This field is only populated when `reviewAnswer` is `DECLINED`.
  - When the value is `RETRY`, the user may resubmit their information and trigger a new KYC review.
  - When the value is `FINAL`, it indicates a hard rejection — resubmission via API is not permitted.
- **rejectReasons** – An array of enums that specify the reasons for a declined screening result. This field is only populated when `reviewAnswer` is `DECLINED`.
- **comment** – A human-readable message providing additional details about the rejection. This field is intended to be shared with developers and end users for better clarity. This field is only populated when `reviewAnswer` is `DECLINED`.

## ACTIVE

Below is an example of a KYC application with an `ACTIVE` status:

```json expandable
{
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "message": "",
    "reviewResult": {
        "reviewAnswer": "APPROVED",
        "reviewRejectType": "",
        "rejectReasons": [],
        "comment": ""
    },
    "details": {
        "identity": {
            "reviewResult": {
                "reviewAnswer": "APPROVED",
                "reviewRejectType": "",
                "rejectReasons": [],
                "comment": ""
            },
            "details": [
                {
                    "id": "989c9fae-9846-48e0-a5c1-2035e9cbd323",
                    "type": "ID_CARD",
                    "subType": "FRONT_SIDE",
                    "reviewResult": {
                        "reviewAnswer": "APPROVED",
                        "reviewRejectType": "",
                        "rejectReasons": [],
                        "comment": ""
                    }
                },
                {
                    "id": "d8b105a2-c506-4cfe-8863-373fc3dfda89",
                    "type": "ID_CARD",
                    "subType": "BACK_SIDE",
                    "reviewResult": {
                        "reviewAnswer": "APPROVED",
                        "reviewRejectType": "",
                        "rejectReasons": [],
                        "comment": ""
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
        "questionnaire": {
            "reviewResult": {
                "reviewAnswer": "APPROVED",
                "reviewRejectType": "",
                "rejectReasons": [],
                "comment": ""
            },
            "details": []
        },
        "personalInfo": {
            "reviewResult": {
                "reviewAnswer": "APPROVED",
                "reviewRejectType": "",
                "rejectReasons": [],
                "comment": ""
            },
            "details": []
        }
    }
}
```

When the top-level `status` is `ACTIVE`, it means the user has been successfully approved for the USD rail, including both compliance screening and bank onboarding.

## INACTIVE

Below is an example of a KYC application with an `INACTIVE` status:

```json expandable
{
    "status": "INACTIVE",
    "message": "",
    "reviewResult": {},
    "details": {}
}
```

When the top-level `status` is `INACTIVE`, it means the user has not yet submitted their KYC application. To submit the KYC application, please call [Submit KYC](https://hifi-wy-fix-doc.mintlify.app/api-reference/kyc/submit-kyc).

## REJECTED

Below is an example of a KYC application with an `REJECTED` status:

```json expandable
{
    "status": "REJECTED",
    "message": "",
    "reviewResult": {},
    "details": {}
}
```

When the top-level `status` is `REJECTED`, it means the user has been denied access to the USD rail, and resubmission is **not allowed**.

<Info>
  Please contact support if you believe the user’s status is incorrect.

## PENDING

Below is an example of a KYC application with an `PENDING` status:

```json expandable
{
    "status": "PENDING",
    "message": "",
    "reviewResult": {
		
	},
    "details": {}
}
```

When the top-level `status` is `PENDING`, it means the user is still undergoing the compliance screening process. This could indicate that the user is either being reviewed by our compliance engine or is in the process of bank onboarding.

<Info>
  Please reach out to support if an individual applicant has remained in this status for more than 24 hours.
</Info>

## RFI-PENDING

Below is an example of a KYC application with an `RFI-PENDING` status:

```json expandable
{
    "status": "RFI-PENDING",
    "message": "",
    "reviewResult": {
		
	},
    "details": {}
}
```

When the top-level **status** is `RFI_PENDING`, it means there is an open RFI (Request for Information) case for this application. Our compliance team has sent an email to your compliance team requesting additional information for this user.

<Info>
  Please closely monitor your mailbox for any RFI requests from **@**[**hifi.com**](http://hifi.com).
