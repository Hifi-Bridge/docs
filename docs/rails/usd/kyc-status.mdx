title: "Understanding the KYC Status Response"
description: "This section provides guidance on how to correctly interpret the KYC status response. It explains the structure of the response object, the meaning of each field, and how to use this information to manage and troubleshoot user KYC applications effectively."
---

For USD rails, we provide detailed KYC information to help developers debug issues or request additional or updated information from end users in order to complete the KYC process.

Below are the possible statuses for a user’s KYC application:

- **ACTIVE**
- **INACTIVE**
- **REJECTED**
- **PENDING**
- **RFI_PENDING**
- **MANUAL_REVIEW**
- **CONTACT_SUPPORT**
- **INCOMPLETE**

We’ll go through each status in detail shortly. But first, let’s take a look at the structure of an individual KYC status response.

## Response Overview

Below is an example of an individual KYC status response:

```json expandable
{
    "status": "",
    "message": "",
    "reviewResult": {
        "reviewAnswer": "",
        "reviewRejectType": "",
        "rejectReasons": [],
        "comment": ""
    },
    "details": {
        "identity": {
			{
        		"reviewAnswer": "",
        		"reviewRejectType": "",
        		"rejectReasons": [],
        		"comment": ""
    		},
			"details": [
				...
			]
        },
        "questionnaire": {
            {
        		"reviewAnswer": "",
        		"reviewRejectType": "",
        		"rejectReasons": [],
        		"comment": ""
    		},
			"details": [
				...
			]
        },
        "personalInfo": {
            {
        		"reviewAnswer": "",
        		"reviewRejectType": "",
        		"rejectReasons": [],
        		"comment": ""
    		},
			"details": [
				...
			]
        },
		"proofOfAddress": {
			{
        		"reviewAnswer": "",
        		"reviewRejectType": "",
        		"rejectReasons": [],
        		"comment": ""
    		},
			"details": [
				...
			]
		}

    }
}
```

At the top level, the KYC status response consists of four main sections:

- **status** – The primary status of the KYC application, indicating its current progress.
- **message** – A human-readable message intended to provide additional context for developers.
- **reviewResult** – A more detailed screening outcome from our compliance engine, which can serve as a secondary reference for understanding a user’s KYC status.
- **details** – A comprehensive breakdown of the compliance categories and data points screened for the applicant.

Under the `details` section, there are four compliance categories that we screen against each individual KYC applicant:

- **identity** – Indicates the screening result of the user’s ID documentation.
- **questionnaire** – Indicates the screening result of the “source of funds and intended use” questionnaire.
- **personalInfo** – Contains the results based on non-document information provided by the user, such as first name, last name, and address.
- **proofOfAddress** – Indicates the screening result of the proof of address (PoA) documentation, if provided during the KYC application.

Let’s also take a look at the `reviewResult` object, which appears both at the top level and within each compliance category.

- **reviewAnswer** – Indicates the outcome of the screening. Possible values are `APPROVED` and `DECLINED`.
- **reviewRejectType** – Indicates whether resubmission is allowed. Possible values are `FINAL` and `RETRY`. This field is only populated when `reviewAnswer` is `DECLINED`.
  - When the value is `RETRY`, the user may resubmit their information and trigger a new KYC review.
  - When the value is `FINAL`, it indicates a hard rejection — resubmission via API is not permitted.
- **rejectReasons** – An array of enums that specify the reasons for a declined screening result. This field is only populated when `reviewAnswer` is `DECLINED`.
- **comment** – A human-readable message providing additional details about the rejection. This field is intended to be shared with developers and end users for better clarity. This field is only populated when `reviewAnswer` is `DECLINED`.

## ACTIVE

Below is an example of a KYC application with an `ACTIVE` status:

```json expandable
{
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "message": "",
    "reviewResult": {
        "reviewAnswer": "APPROVED",
        "reviewRejectType": "",
        "rejectReasons": [],
        "comment": ""
    },
    "details": {
        "identity": {
            "reviewResult": {
                "reviewAnswer": "APPROVED",
                "reviewRejectType": "",
                "rejectReasons": [],
                "comment": ""
            },
            "details": [
                {
                    "id": "989c9fae-9846-48e0-a5c1-2035e9cbd323",
                    "type": "ID_CARD",
                    "subType": "FRONT_SIDE",
                    "reviewResult": {
                        "reviewAnswer": "APPROVED",
                        "reviewRejectType": "",
                        "rejectReasons": [],
                        "comment": ""
                    }
                },
                {
                    "id": "d8b105a2-c506-4cfe-8863-373fc3dfda89",
                    "type": "ID_CARD",
                    "subType": "BACK_SIDE",
                    "reviewResult": {
                        "reviewAnswer": "APPROVED",
                        "reviewRejectType": "",
                        "rejectReasons": [],
                        "comment": ""
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
        "questionnaire": {
            "reviewResult": {
                "reviewAnswer": "APPROVED",
                "reviewRejectType": "",
                "rejectReasons": [],
                "comment": ""
            },
            "details": []
        },
        "personalInfo": {
            "reviewResult": {
                "reviewAnswer": "APPROVED",
                "reviewRejectType": "",
                "rejectReasons": [],
                "comment": ""
            },
            "details": []
        }
    }
}
```

When the top-level `status` is `ACTIVE`, it means the user has been successfully approved for the USD rail, including both compliance screening and bank onboarding.

## INACTIVE

Below is an example of a KYC application with an `INACTIVE` status:

```json expandable
{
    "status": "INACTIVE",
    "message": "",
    "reviewResult": {...},
    "details": {...}
}
```

When the top-level `status` is `INACTIVE`, it means the user has not yet submitted their KYC application. To submit the KYC application, please call [Submit KYC](https://hifi-wy-fix-doc.mintlify.app/api-reference/kyc/submit-kyc).

## REJECTED

Below is an example of a KYC application with an `REJECTED` status:

```json expandable
{
    "status": "REJECTED",
    "message": "",
    "reviewResult": {...},
    "details": {...}
}
```

When the top-level `status` is `REJECTED`, it means the user has been denied access to the USD rail, and resubmission is **not allowed**.

<Info>
  Please contact support if you believe the user’s status is incorrect.
</Info>

## PENDING

Below is an example of a KYC application with an `PENDING` status:

```json expandable
{
    "status": "PENDING",
    "message": "",
    "reviewResult": {...},
    "details": {...}
}
```

When the top-level `status` is `PENDING`, it means the user is still undergoing the compliance screening process. This could indicate that the user is either being reviewed by our compliance engine or is in the process of bank onboarding.

<Info>
  Please reach out to support if an individual applicant has remained in this status for more than 24 hours.
</Info>

## RFI_PENDING

Below is an example of a KYC application with an `RFI_PENDING` status:

```json expandable
{
    "status": "RFI_PENDING",
    "message": "",
    "reviewResult": {...},
    "details": {...}
}
```

When the top-level **status** is `RFI_PENDING`, it means there is an open RFI (Request for Information) case for this application. Our compliance team has sent an email to your compliance team requesting additional information for this user.

<Info>
  Please closely monitor your mailbox for any RFI requests from **@**[**hifi.com**](http://hifi.com).
</Info>

## MANUAL_REVIEW

Below is an example of a KYC application with an `MANUAL_REVIEW` status:

```json expandable
{
    "status": "MANUAL_REVIEW",
    "message": "",
    "reviewResult": {...},
    "details": {...}
}
```

When the top-level status is `MANUAL_REVIEW`, it means our compliance team is manually reviewing the KYC information provided by the user. This usually occurs after the `PENDING` status, when a more detailed investigation is required before proceeding to the next step.

<Info>
  Please reach out to support if an individual applicant has remained in this status for more than 24 hours.
</Info>

## CONTACT_SUPPORT

Below is an example of a KYC application with an `CONTACT_SUPPORT` status:

```json expandable
{
    "status": "CONTACT_SUPPORT",
    "message": "",
    "reviewResult": {...},
    "details": {...}
}
```

When the top-level status is `CONTACT_SUPPORT`, it means our system was unable to properly process the KYC or return the correct user status. Please reach out to support if you encounter this status for an individual user.

## INCOMPLETE

Below is an example of a KYC application with an `INCOMPLETE` status:

```json expandable
{
    "status": "INCOMPLETE",
    "message": "",
    "reviewResult": {
        "reviewAnswer": "DECLINED",
        "reviewRejectType": "RETRY",
        "rejectReasons": [
            "BAD_PROOF_OF_IDENTITY"
        ],
        "comment": ""
    },
    "details": {
        "identity": {
            "reviewResult": {
                "reviewAnswer": "DECLINED",
                "reviewRejectType": "RETRY",
                "rejectReasons": [],
                "comment": "The uploaded document is not acceptable or no longer valid. Upload a different document."
            },
            "details": [
                {
                    "id": "42e54f82-dd1d-4cdf-844c-fd56fcfcdb8e",
                    "type": "ID_CARD",
                    "subType": "BACK_SIDE",
                    "reviewResult": {
                        "reviewAnswer": "DECLINED",
                        "reviewRejectType": "RETRY",
                        "rejectReasons": [
                            "BAD_PROOF_OF_IDENTITY"
                        ],
                        "comment": "The uploaded document is not acceptable or no longer valid. Upload a different document."
                    }
                },
                {
                    "id": "0b13ba7c-b89b-4c2b-8685-bd23ec175d29",
                    "type": "ID_CARD",
                    "subType": "FRONT_SIDE",
                    "reviewResult": {
                        "reviewAnswer": "DECLINED",
                        "reviewRejectType": "RETRY",
                        "rejectReasons": [
                            "BAD_PROOF_OF_IDENTITY"
                        ],
                        "comment": "The uploaded document is not acceptable or no longer valid. Upload a different document."
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
        "questionnaire": {
            "reviewResult": {
                "reviewAnswer": "APPROVED",
                "reviewRejectType": "",
                "rejectReasons": [],
                "comment": ""
            },
            "details": []
        },
        "personalInfo": {
            "reviewResult": {
                "reviewAnswer": "APPROVED",
                "reviewRejectType": "",
                "rejectReasons": [],
                "comment": ""
            },
            "details": []
        }
    }
}
```

When you see the `INCOMPLETE` status, it means the data the user submitted requires updates in order to continue the KYC application. At this stage, you are allowed to use HIFI's API to programmatically [update the user's KYC information](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/kyc/update-kyc-information) and [re-submit](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/kyc/submit-kyc) it once ready.

In the above example, we can see that there is an issue with the user's `identity` section.

```json
"reviewResult": {
	"reviewAnswer": "DECLINED",
	"reviewRejectType": "RETRY",
	"rejectReasons": [],
	"comment": "The uploaded document is not acceptable or no longer valid. Upload a different document."
}
```

From the `reviewResult` under the identity section, we can see that the compliance information is `DECLINED` and a `RETRY` is allowed. The `comment` contains human-readable information regarding the reason for the rejection.

In this situation, you should use the [update documentation endpoint](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/kyc/update-a-document) to update the ID documentation previously submitted for compliance screening. If the user wishes to submit a different type of documentation, you can also use the [add documentation endpoint](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/kyc/add-documents).

If proof-of-address documentation was submitted during the initial KYC screening process, you will also see `proofOfAddress` among all the KYC screening categories.

```json expandable
{
    "status": "INCOMPLETE",
    "message": "",
    "reviewResult": {
        "reviewAnswer": "DECLINED",
        "reviewRejectType": "RETRY",
        "rejectReasons": [
            "BAD_PROOF_OF_IDENTITY"
        ],
        "comment": ""
    },
    "details": {
        "identity": {
            ...
        },
        "questionnaire": {
            ...
        },
        "personalInfo": {
            ...
        },
        "proofOfAddress": {
            "reviewResult": {
				"reviewAnswer": "DECLINED",
				"reviewRejectType": "RETRY",
				"rejectReasons": [],
				"comment": "The uploaded document is not acceptable or no longer valid. Upload a different document."
			}
            "details": [
                {
                    "id": "13b89554-f077-4bfa-a22a-285ede06d89f",
                    "type": "PROOF_OF_ADDRESS",
                    "subType": "SINGLE_SIDE",
                    "reviewResult": {
						"reviewAnswer": "DECLINED",
						"reviewRejectType": "RETRY",
						"rejectReasons": [],
						"comment": "The uploaded document is not acceptable or no longer valid. Upload a different document."
					}
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Below is a table showing the KYC information categorized under each section.

| Section        | KYC Fields |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| identity       |            |
| questionnaire  |            |
| personalInfo   |            |
| proofOfAddress |            |
