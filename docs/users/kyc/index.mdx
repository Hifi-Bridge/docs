HIFI enforces **KYC (Know Your Customer)** and **KYB (Know Your Business)** checks to comply with financial regulations.

KYC verification typically takes:

- **Individual Users**: 1 business day
- **Business Users**: 1-3 business days, depending on complexity

During the onboarding process, you'll be asked to provide a **compliance email address**. This email will be used to contact you for any additional information requests during KYC review.
