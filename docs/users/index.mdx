A **User** represents an individual or a business entity interacting with the HIFI platform.
Users are the foundation of most HIFI operations: before you can create Wallets or move money, a User record must exist.

HIFI supports two types of Users:

- **Individual** – a natural person (e.g., a customer, freelancer, or employee).
- **Business** – a legal entity (e.g., a company, NGO, or partnership).

## Creating Users
