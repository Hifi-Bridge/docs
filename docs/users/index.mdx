A **User** represents an individual or business on the HIFI platform. Users are the foundation of all transaction activity - every onramp, offramp, and transfer is associated with a user.

## User Types

HIFI supports two types of users:

| Type           | Description      | Use Cases                                 |
| :------------- | :--------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| **Individual** | A natural person | Personal accounts, freelancers, employees |
| **Business**   | A legal entity   | Companies, NGOs, partnerships             |

## User Capabilities

What users can do depends on their verification status:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Unverified Users">
    **Available immediately after creation:**
    - ✅ Receive cryptocurrency to their wallet addresses
    - ✅ Send cryptocurrency to other HIFI users
    - ✅ Transfer crypto to external wallets
    
    **Not available:**
    - ❌ Fiat onramp (deposit USD to receive stablecoins)
    - ❌ Fiat offramp (send stablecoins to receive USD)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="KYC-Verified Users">
    **All unverified capabilities, plus:**
    - ✅ Onramp fiat to stablecoins via virtual accounts
    - ✅ Offramp stablecoins to fiat bank accounts
    - ✅ Access to regulated fiat rails (USD, EUR, etc.)
    
    **Requirements:**
    - Complete KYC verification for desired rails
    - Maintain active compliance status
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## User Lifecycle

### Creation

Users are created in two steps:

1. **Generate Terms of Service link** - User must review and accept HIFI's Terms of Service
2. **Create user record** - Once terms are accepted, create the user with basic information

Upon creation, users are automatically provisioned with cryptocurrency wallet addresses on supported blockchains (Polygon, Ethereum, etc.). These wallets are immediately functional for sending and receiving digital assets.

**Create a user:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/users" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "individual",
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "dateOfBirth": "1990-05-15",
    "address": {
      "addressLine1": "456 Market St",
      "city": "San Francisco",
      "stateProvinceRegion": "CA",
      "postalCode": "94102",
      "country": "USA"
    },
    "signedAgreementId": "8cb49537-bcf9-41b1-8d8c-c9c200d7341b",
    "requestId": "705f1f8b-a080-467c-b683-174eca409928"
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "usr_abc123",
  "type": "individual",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "wallets": {
    "INDIVIDUAL": {
      "POLYGON": {
        "address": "0x1b932E54e77Aeb698144550d5a493Ea99E20Daa7"
      },
      "ETHEREUM": {
        "address": "0xC1c767eaB34b3Cc2C33a354f6Ff2c20fCB98D3C9"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Verification

To unlock fiat rails, users must complete KYC (Know Your Customer) verification. KYC requirements vary by rail (USD, EUR, etc.) and include:

- Personal information (name, date of birth, address, tax ID)
- Identity documents (passport, driver's license, or ID card)
- Proof of address (in some cases)

The KYC process typically takes:

- **Sandbox:** Auto-approved within minutes for testing
- **Production:** 1-3 business days for manual review

Once approved, the user can access fiat onramp and offramp capabilities for that specific rail.

**Check KYC status:**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/users/usr_abc123/kyc/status?rails=USD" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Management

Users can be updated throughout their lifecycle to:

- Update contact information
- Add or modify KYC data
- Link additional bank accounts
- Add virtual accounts for different currencies

**Retrieve user details:**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/users/usr_abc123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## User Wallets

Every user receives wallet addresses on supported blockchains automatically at creation. These wallets are:

- **Custodial** - Managed by HIFI for security and compliance
- **Multi-chain** - Available on Polygon, Ethereum, Base, Solana, Flow and other supported networks
- **Immediately active** - Ready to send and receive crypto without additional setup

Wallet addresses never change and can be shared with other users or external parties for receiving cryptocurrency.

## User Accounts

Users can have multiple account types for different purposes:

| Account Type        | Purpose               | Direction               |
| :------------------ | :-------------------- | :---------------------- |
| **Virtual Account** | Receive fiat deposits | Fiat → Crypto (onramp)  |
| **Offramp Account** | Send fiat withdrawals | Crypto → Fiat (offramp) |

These accounts are created separately after user creation and require KYC verification to be functional.

## Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Terms of Service">
    Before creating a user, they must accept HIFI's Terms of Service. This ensures compliance with data handling and regulatory requirements. The `signedAgreementId` from the ToS acceptance is required when creating the user.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Request IDs">
  All user creation requests require a `requestId` (UUID). This ensures
  idempotency - retrying the same request won't create duplicate users.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Rails & KYC">
  A "rail" is a payment corridor enabling conversions between specific fiat
  currencies and stablecoins. For example, the USD rail allows conversion
  between USD and USDC. Each rail has its own KYC requirements.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Patterns

### Create and verify a user

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate ToS link">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/tos-link" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"idempotencyKey": "8cb49537-bcf9-41b1-8d8c-c9c200d7341b"}'
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create user (after ToS accepted)">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/users" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "type": "individual",
        "firstName": "Jane",
        "lastName": "Smith",
        "email": "jane@example.com",
        "signedAgreementId": "8cb49537-bcf9-41b1-8d8c-c9c200d7341b",
        "requestId": "705f1f8b-a080-467c-b683-174eca409928"
      }'
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update KYC information">
    Provide required personal information:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/users/usr_abc123/kyc" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "phone": "+14155551234",
        "taxIdentificationNumber": "123456789",
        "nationality": "USA"
      }'
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload identity documents">
    First, upload the document files:
    ```bash
    # Upload front side
    curl -X POST "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/files" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
      -F "file=@drivers_license_front.png"

    # Upload back side
    curl -X POST "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/files" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
      -F "file=@drivers_license_back.png"
    ```

    Then attach the documents to the user's KYC:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/users/usr_abc123/kyc/documents" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '[
        {
          "type": "DRIVERS",
          "subType": "FRONT_SIDE",
          "issuedCountry": "USA",
          "fileId": "file_JzALYV2L1-4LBmaxZ6GCm"
        },
        {
          "type": "DRIVERS",
          "subType": "BACK_SIDE",
          "issuedCountry": "USA",
          "fileId": "file_KpBMZW3M2-5MCnbyA7HDn"
        }
      ]'
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit KYC application">
    Submit for review once all information and documents are provided:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/users/usr_abc123/kyc/submissions" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"rails": "USD"}'
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Check user capabilities

Determine what a user can do based on their KYC status:
