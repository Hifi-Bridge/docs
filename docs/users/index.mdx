A **User** represents an individual or a business entity interacting with the HIFI platform.
Users are the foundation of most HIFI operations: before you can create wallets or move money, a user record must exist.

HIFI supports two types of users:

- **Individual** – a natural person (e.g., a customer, freelancer, or employee).
- **Business** – a legal entity (e.g., a company, NGO, or partnership).
