A **Terms of Service agreement ID** is required to create a user.
This ensures you have consent for data handling, compliance screening, and financial activity.

You can obtain a TOS agreement ID in two ways:

1. **Using the API** – Call the [Generate Terms of Service Link](/api-reference/user/generate-a-terms-of-service-link) endpoint with an idempotency key to get a unique URL. After users accept the terms at this link, the key becomes your signed agreement ID.

2. **Using the Dashboard** – On the Dashboard, you can simply click a button when creating a user to accept the TOS link.
