title: "KYC Link"
---

The KYC Link API allows you to create a secure link for User onboarding and KYC (Know Your Customer) verification. This endpoint provides flexibility to either create new Users or update existing ones through a single interface.

## How it works

- **Create a new User** if no User ID is provided
- **Submit KYC for a User** if a ID is passed
- **Configure redirect behavior** after KYC completion
- **Customize the logo** with a templat

## API Usage

Generate a KYC link using the following endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://production.hifibridge.com/v2/kyc-link" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userType": "INDIVIDUAL",
    "rails": [
      "USD"
    ],
    "redirectUrl": "https://yourapp.com/kyc-complete",
    "recipientEmail": "user@example.com",
    "templateId": "xyz"
  }'
```

## Redirect URL

When a `redirectUrl` is provided, users will be redirected to that URL after completing their KYC information. The User ID will be automatically appended as a query parameter:

```
https://yourapp.com/kyc-complete?userId=user_123456789
```

## Recipient Email

The `recipientEmail` parameter allows you to automatically send the KYC link to users. This feature is only available in production environments for security reasons.

## Template ID

You can set a template ID to show your company logo for a branded experience. Contact HIFI support to configure a template ID for your account.
