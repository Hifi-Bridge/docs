title: "KYC Link"
---

The KYC Link API allows you to create a secure link for user onboarding and KYC (Know Your Customer) verification. This endpoint provides flexibility to either create new users or update existing ones through a single interface.

## Overview

The KYC link generation endpoint lets you:

- Create a new user if no user ID is provided
- Update an existing user if a user ID is passed
- Configure redirect behavior after KYC completion
- Send the link via email to users
- Customize the KYC experience with a template

## Redirect URL

When a `redirectUrl` is provided, users will be redirected to that URL after completing their KYC information. The user ID will be automatically appended as a query parameter:

```
https://yourapp.com/kyc-complete?userId=user_123456789
```

## Recipient Email

The `recipientEmail` parameter allows you to automatically send the KYC link to users. This feature is only available in production environments for security reasons.

## Custom Templates

You can set a template ID to show your company logo for a branded experience. Contact HIFI support to configure a template ID for your account.
