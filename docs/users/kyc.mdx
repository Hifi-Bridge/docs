title: "KYC/KYB"
---

When a User needs to interact with a fiat account (for onramps or offramps), HIFI enforces **KYC (Know Your Customer)** and **KYB (Know Your Business)** checks to comply with financial regulations.

During the onboarding process, you'll be asked to provide a **compliance email
address**. This email will be used to contact you for any additional
information requests during KYC review.

<Info>
  KYC verification typically takes a few minutes for Individual Users and
  between 1 to 3 days for Business Users, depending on structure.
</Info>

## Rails

KYC requirements are grouped by **Rail** - each rail has specific compliance requirements based on the regions and currencies it supports. Users must complete KYC for each rail they want to use.

**Rail-specific KYC:**

- **USD Rail**: US compliance requirements for ACH, RTP, and Wire transfers
- **Global Network Rail**: Multi-region requirements for Asia and Africa payouts
- **Africa Rail**: Local African market compliance requirements
- **South America Rail**: South American market compliance requirements

## KYC Requirements

The KYC Requirements endpoint lets you retrieve what documents and information are required, optional, or invalid for a specific user and rail combination. If you want to figure out what to submit for a user's KYC, you can fetch the requirements first to understand exactly what information and documents are needed.

**What you get:**

- **Required**: Documents and information that must be provided
- **Optional**: Additional documents that can help with verification
- **Invalid**: Documents that are not accepted for this rail/user combination

This endpoint helps you understand exactly what to collect from users before submitting their KYC information.

## KYC Status

Once you submit KYC information, it enters the compliance review process. Use the KYC Status endpoint to track the progress and get real-time updates.

**Status updates include:**

- **Pending**: KYC is under review
- **Approved**: User is verified and can use the rail
- **Rejected**: Additional information or documents are needed
- **Under Review**: Compliance team is actively reviewing

The status endpoint provides detailed information about what's happening during the review process and any actions required from you or the user.

## KYC Link

If you don't want to use the API directly, you can generate a KYC link and share it with your users. This approach allows users to complete their KYC verification through a web interface without requiring API integration on your end.
