Wallets can receive funds through:

- **Transfers** (stablecoin deposits from supported networks). This includes other HIFI and external wallets.

- **Onramps** (Local payment methods, e.g. bank transfers, PIX, ACH).  
  When a User pays in fiat (e.g. USD), it is converted into stablecoin and credited to their wallet.

## Transfers

To track incoming transfers into a Wallet, use the Deposits API. This API provides updates on all incoming activity, including transaction hashes, amounts, and confirmation status.
