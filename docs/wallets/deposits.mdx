Wallets can receive funds through:

- **Blockchain transfers** (stablecoin deposits from supported networks). This includes other HIFI and external wallets.

- **Fiat onramps** (local payment methods, e.g. bank transfers, PIX, ACH).  
  When a User pays in fiat (e.g. USD), it is converted into stablecoin and credited to their wallet.

## Blockchain transfers

To track incoming transfers into a Wallet, use the Deposits API. This API provides updates on all incoming activity, including transaction hashes, amounts, and confirmation status.

## Fiat onramps

Convert fiat currency to stablecoins using local payment methods like bank transfers, PIX, or ACH. When users pay in fiat (e.g. USD), it's automatically converted to stablecoin and credited to their wallet.
