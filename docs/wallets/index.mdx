## Deposits

Wallets can receive funds through:

- **Local payment methods** (onramps, e.g. bank transfers, PIX, ACH).  
  When a user pays in fiat (e.g. USD), it is converted into stablecoin and credited to their wallet.

- **Blockchain transfers** (stablecoin deposits from supported networks).

You can subscribe to notifications to be alerted when a new deposit arrives or when funds are credited to a wallet.
