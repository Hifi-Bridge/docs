A **Wallet** is the core account for holding and moving money on the HIFI platform. Every wallet belongs to a **User** (individual or business) and can hold balances in supported stablecoins across blockchain networks.

The HIFI wallet is a **multichain wallet** that supports transactions on hundreds of blockchains including Ethereum, Solana, Base, and more. Users have full custody of their wallets without needing to manage secret keys, and can seamlessly interact with tokenized assets across multiple networks.
