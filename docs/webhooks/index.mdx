When integrating with HIFI's stablecoin infrastructure, it is essential for your application to respond to events in real time. By doing so, your backend systems can promptly take appropriate actions based on events occurring within your HIFI accounts.

## Webhook Registration
To start receiving webhook events, register a webhook endpoint. Once registered, HIFI will push real-time event data to your application's webhook endpoint whenever an event occurs in your HIFI account. Webhook events are delivered via HTTPS as a JSON payload containing an Event object.

Receiving webhook events is particularly valuable for monitoring asynchronous events such as when a transaction is confirmed or a user's KYC status for a rail is updated.

## Event Overview

By registering webhook endpoints, you enable HIFI to automatically send Event objects as part of POST requests to the registered webhook endpoint hosted by your application. Once your webhook endpoint receives an Event, your application can execute backend actions, such as updating transaction records or notifying users about the event.

Below is an example of an event you will receive after successfully creating a HIFI user:

```json
{
  "eventId": "evt_1957117404034e3ade",
  "eventCategory": "USER",
  "eventType": "USER.STATUS.CREATE",
  "eventAction": "CREATE",
  "data": {
    "id": "c5a11cdb-2696-4a2e-ac58-3e17fb230288",
    "name": "William Yang",
    "type": "individual",
    "email": "william.yang@hifibridge.com",
    "wallets": {
      "INDIVIDUAL": {
        "POLYGON_AMOY": {
          "address": "0xa8A642FBA80749318036C97344fC73aE0B64c608"
        },
        "ETHEREUM_TESTNET": {
          "address": "0x5743Af611b44F0934A7eF0cCE6877879375824D9"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "createdAt": "2025-03-07T14:51:44.099Z",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-07T14:52:00.375Z",
  "version": "v2"
}
```

## Retry Behavior

HIFI will attempt to re-deliver a given event to your webhook endpoint for up to 24 hours using exponential backoff if it does not receive a 2xx status from the webhook endpoint.

<Info>Retry interval: 60 seconds - 1 hour</Info>

If your endpoint is disabled or deleted when HIFI attempts a retry, future retries of that event will be prevented. However, if you disable and then re-enable the webhook endpoint before HIFI retries, you can still expect future retry attempts.

## Data Integrity

After activating your webhook, you will receive a webhook secret. This secret is used to sign the payload using JWT, and the signature is included in the Authorization header of the request. You must verify this signature to ensure the authenticity of the event. By validating the JWT signature with your webhook secret, you can confirm that the event was sent by HIFI and that the data has not been tampered with during transmission. This verification step is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of your webhook integration.

```bash
# Replace \n if needed
WEBHOOK_PUBLIC_KEY="-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n...........\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n"
```

```python Python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    auth_header = request.headers.get('Authorization')
    if not auth_header:
        return 'Authorization header is missing', 401

    jwt_token = auth_header.split(' ')[1]

    try:
        decoded = jwt.decode(jwt_token, webhook_public_key, algorithms=['RS256'])
        print('Token is valid. Decoded payload:', decoded)
        # Process the decoded payload as needed
        return '', 200
    except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
        print('Token has expired')
        return 'Token has expired', 401
    except jwt.InvalidTokenError as e:
        print('Failed to verify token:', str(e))
        return 'Token verification failed', 401

    app.run(port=port)

const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");

const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post("/webhook", (req, res) => {
  const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
  if (!authHeader) {
    return res.status(401).send("Authorization header is missing");
  }

  const jwtToken = authHeader.split(" ")[1];

  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(jwtToken, webhookPublicKey, {
      algorithms: ["RS256"],
    });
    console.log("Token is valid. Decoded payload:", decoded);
    // Process the decoded payload as needed
    res.status(200).send("");
