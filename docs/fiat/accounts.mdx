To pay in or out of a HIFI Wallet, you need to create an Account.

- **Onramp Accounts**: receive fiat money
- **Offramp Accounts**: send fiat money

## Onramp Accounts

Onramp Accounts allow Users to receive money from a bank account into their HIFI Wallet.
We support payins from first and third-party Accounts, which means Users can
receive money from themselves or from others.

## Offramp Accounts

Offramp Accounts allow Users to transfer money from their HIFI Wallet to a bank account.
We also support first and third-party payouts.

## Creating Accounts

To create an Account for a User, you have to first unlock the relevant Rail. A Rail is a collection of fiat payment methods.
