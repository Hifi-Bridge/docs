HIFI is a stablecoin infrastructure platform. We're building the financial layer for instant, borderless, programmable money. We provide APIs and tools for developers to build software with stablecoins.

## Getting Started

To start using HIFI, you need access to our Developer Dashboard. On the Dashboard, you can try out the product in sandbox or get API keys for integration. Schedule a call with our team to discuss your use case.
