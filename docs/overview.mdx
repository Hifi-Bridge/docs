### Dollar access

Our most common use case is to convert fiat into stablecoins. We provide APIs to convert from USD via ACH, RTP and SWIFT. We also support local payment methods in Africa, Asia and South America.

### Blockchain finance

Companies like Dapper use HIFI to build and operate blockchain-based financial systems. They hold thousands of wallets for their users and trade between them using our transfers endpoints.

### Sending money

The HIFI API and Dashboard is one of the best ways to send money across the world, either from fiat accounts or stablecoin wallets.
