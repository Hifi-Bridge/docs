HIFI is a stablecoin infrastructure platform. We 're building a new financial layer for instant, borderless, money.

## Getting started

HIFI provides two ways to get started: using our APIs for programmatic integration or using our Dashboard for manual operations and testing.

### Using the API

Our APIs make it easy to:

- Create and manage user wallets
- Convert between fiat and stablecoins
- Send money globally with low fees
- Build compliant financial services

You can get started in minutes with our quickstart guide:

### Using the Dashboard

The HIFI Dashboard provides a web interface for managing all aspects of your HIFI integration. Everything you can do via API can also be done through the Dashboard's intuitive interface.

### Sandbox Environment

Test your integration safely with our sandbox environment. All tokens and balances are simulated and hold no real-world value, making it perfect for development and testing.
