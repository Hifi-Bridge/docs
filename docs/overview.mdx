HIFI is a stablecoin infrastructure platform. We provide APIs and tools for developers to hold, program and distribute money over the internet.

## Use Cases

We're building a new financial layer by connecting the global banking system to blockchain infrastructure. Our mission is to inspire a new generation of software designed with internet-native financial systems.

### Dollar access

Our most common use case is to convert fiat into stablecoins. We provide APIs to convert from USD via ACH, RTP and SWIFT. We also support local payment methods in Africa, Asia and South America.
