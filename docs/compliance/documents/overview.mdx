This guide is for documents managed through the [Documents](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/kyc/add-documents) endpoints.

<Callout icon="ðŸš§" theme="warn">
  **Important**

  Currently, the Documents endpoints are only used for the `USD` rail. All other rails still rely on the inline `*Url` fields in the Update KYC Information endpoints to manage files. We are prioritizing migration so that all rails use the [Documents](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/kyc/add-documents) endpoints for file handling.

## Documents Overview

Each document has three main attributes:

* `type`
* `subType`
* `issuedCountry`

## Supported Document Types

The supported document types depend on the user type, either `individual` or `business`.

## Document SubTypes

The possible `subType` are:

* `FRONT_SIDE`
* `BACK_SIDE`
* `SINGLE_SIDE`

`FRONT_SIDE` and `BACK_SIDE` apply only to identity documents such as `ID_CARD` and `DRIVERS_LICENSE`.
All other document types should use only `SINGLE_SIDE` as the subType.

## Document Groups

Compliance requirements are defined at the group level. A user must provide documents that satisfy all groups required by the rail.

**Example:**
For an individual, the `identity` document group is required. This group can be satisfied by submitting any one of the following:

* `DRIVERS_LICENSE`
* `ID_CARD`
* `PASSPORT`
* `RESIDENCE_PERMIT`
