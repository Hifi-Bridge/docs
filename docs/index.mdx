Welcome to **HIFI**, the API platform for building payment workflows. Onboard users, open virtual accounts, move money across stablecoins and fiat rails, and automate complex payment operations. This guide will help you integrate our APIs and launch your product with confidence.

## What you can do

With HIFI, you can design financial systems that move value instantly, securely, and globally — all through one connected platform.

- **Send and receive payments:**
  Move money between fiat and stablecoins across borders through a single API.
- **Create virtual accounts:**
  Issue deposit accounts for users in supported currencies to manage deposits and withdrawals.
- **Provision wallets:**
  Generate custodial wallets for users or businesses to hold and transfer funds securely.
- **Bridge on-chain assets:**
  Transfer or swap digital assets between chains using quote-based or non-quote-based on-chain operations.
- **Automate fund flows:**
  Use APIs to manage internal transfers, settlements, and liquidity automatically.

## Common use cases

- **Cross-Border Payments:** Enable users to send money internationally through stablecoins. Convert fiat to USDC, transfer across borders instantly, and offramp to local currency.
- **Treasury Automation:** Automate business treasury operations with settlement rules and batch transfers. Route incoming deposits automatically and distribute funds to multiple accounts.
- **Remittances:** Build remittance products for users sending money home. Support multiple currencies and geographic regions.
- **Payroll & Payouts:** Distribute payroll or contractor payments efficiently. Send payments to multiple recipients with a single API integration, reducing costs and complexity.
- **Marketplaces:** Enable crypto-native payments in marketplaces. Allow users to onramp fiat, make purchases, and offramp earnings back to their bank accounts.
- **DeFi Integration:** Connect traditional finance with DeFi protocols. Users can onramp fiat, interact with DeFi applications, and offramp profits back to traditional banking.
- **Fintech Applications:** Build comprehensive fintech products with multi-currency support, virtual accounts, and automated compliance. Focus on product features while HIFI handles infrastructure.
