## How Offramps Work

Offramps follow a quote-based flow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create offramp request">
    Specify the source wallet, destination account, and amount to convert.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review quote">
    Examine the exchange rate, fees, and quote expiration time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accept quote">
    Accept the quote to execute the conversion. Stablecoins are converted to fiat and sent to the registered bank account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating Offramps

Use the [Create Offramp](https://docs.hifi.com/api-reference/offramp/create-an-offramp) endpoint to get a quote.

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/offramps" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

## Accepting Quotes

After reviewing the quote, accept it to execute the conversion using the [Accept Quote](https://docs.hifi.com/api-reference/offramp/accept-quote) endpoint.

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/offramps/173c1e89-7bbd-4352-9e5d-73807681510d/quote/accept" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

When the quote is accepted, the response shows the updated status:

<Accordion title="Response">
  ```json
  {
    "transferType": "OFFRAMP",
    "transferDetails": {
      "id": "off_abc123",
      "status": "CRYPTO_INITIATED",

  ```
</Accordion>

<ResponseField name="transferDetails.status" type="string">
  Updated offramp status. `CRYPTO_INITIATED` means the conversion has started. See [Transaction Status](#transaction-status) for progression.
</ResponseField>

Once accepted, the offramp progresses through crypto and fiat processing phases until completion.

## Transaction Status

Offramps progress through several phases:

### System Statuses

| Status             | Description                                    |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |

| **AWAITING_FUNDS** | Awaiting for crypto deposit                    |

### Crypto Processing Phase

| Status               | Description                                            |

## Tracking Offramps

<Note>
  **Status Updates:** Subscribe to `OFFRAMP` webhook events to receive real-time status notifications. See [Webhooks](/webhooks/offramp-events) for setup instructions.
</Note>

Monitor offramp status using the [Retrieve Offramp](https://docs.hifi.com/api-reference/offramp/retrieve-an-offramp) endpoint. The response structure matches the create endpoint shown above.

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/offramps/173c1e89-7bbd-4352-9e5d-73807681510d" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Quote Validity

Quotes expire **10 minutes** after creation to ensure current market rates. This prevents:

- Stale pricing during volatile markets
- Long-pending transactions
- Rate arbitrage

If your quote expires (status becomes `QUOTE_FAILED`):

1. Create a new offramp request
2. Review the updated quote
3. Accept the new quote within 10 minutes

<Warning>
  **Time Sensitive:** Always check `quoteInformation.expiresAt` before accepting. Attempting to accept an expired quote will fail.
</Warning>

## Purpose of Payment Code

Payment Purpose Codes (PPCs), also known as payment reason codes, are standardized identifiers that provide the reason for a crossborder or international payment. PPCs enable payers to categorize the payment, whether for goods, services, investments, or other purposes. In crossborder payments, PPCs add an additional layer of transparency by ensuring funds are used for legitimate purposes and are considered mandatory or required fields by the Central Banking authority in certain jurisdictions, i.e. India, Malaysia, and the United Arab Emirates.

## Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Quote Information">
    The quote provides complete pricing transparency:

    - **sendGross**: Total stablecoins being converted
    - **sendNet**: Net amount after fees
    - **receiveGross**: Total fiat before fees
    - **receiveNet**: Actual fiat you'll receive
    - **rate**: Exchange rate (stablecoin to fiat)
    - **expiresAt**: Quote expiration timestamp

    Always verify `receiveNet` matches your expectations before accepting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Developer Fees">
    Monetize offramp transactions by adding a developer fee when creating the offramp:

    **FIX**: Fixed amount regardless of transaction size

    ```json
    {
      "fee": {
        "type": "FIX",
        "value": 0.5
      }
    }
    ```

    **PERCENT**: Percentage of transaction amount

    ```json
    {
      "fee": {
        "type": "PERCENT",
        "value": 0.01
      }
    }
    ```

    Developer fees are paid in stablecoins from the source wallet before conversion.
  </Accordion>
  {" "}

  <Accordion title="USDT Fee">
    USDT offramps incur an additional 0.1% exchange fee beyond standard rates. This fee appears on your monthly invoice, not deducted from the transaction amount.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Account Requirements">
    Before creating offramps, ensure:

    - User has completed KYC for the destination currency's rail
    - Offramp account is created and active (status: `ACTIVE`)
    - Sufficient stablecoin balance in the source wallet
