## Overview

Swaps let you exchange one stablecoin for another within HIFI wallet. All swaps follow a two-step process: create the swap request, then accept it to execute the exchange.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create swap request">
    Specify source currency, destination currency, and amount to exchange. The swap is created with `OPEN_QUOTE` status.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accept the swap">
    Accept the swap using the [Accept
    Swap](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/swap/accept-a-swap) endpoint to execute the exchange.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Completion">
    Receive the swapped currency in the destination wallet once the swap is accepted and executed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating Swaps

Use the [Create Swap](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/swap/create-a-swap) endpoint to exchange currencies on the same chain.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Swap with Source Amount
curl -X POST "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/wallets/swaps" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "requestId": "1ab3e6e0-4839-4dbe-89c3-b06d9645ae86",

      "userId": "usr_abc123",

## Accepting Swaps

All swaps are created in `PENDING` status and require explicit acceptance before execution. Use the [Accept Swap](https://docs.hifibridge.com/api-reference/swap/accept-a-swap) endpoint to accept and execute a swap.

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/wallets/swaps/swp_abc123/accept" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

The accept endpoint returns the same swap details structure as the create endpoint, with updated status:

<Note>
  **Required Step:** All swaps must be accepted before execution. After creating a swap, always call the accept endpoint to execute the exchange.
</Note>

## Transaction Status

Swaps progress through the following statuses:

| Status        | Description                                                  |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PENDING**   | Swap request created and processing                          |
| **COMPLETED** | Swap successfully executed                                   |
| **FAILED**    | Swap failed (check `error` and `errorDetails` for specifics) |
| **CANCELLED** | Swap was cancelled before execution                          |

<Note>
  **Status Updates:** Subscribe to `SWAP.CREATE` and `SWAP.UPDATE` webhook events to receive real-time status notifications. See [Webhooks](/docs/webhooks) for setup instructions.
</Note>

</Note>

## Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Amount Specification">
    You can specify the amount in either source or destination:

    **Source amount** (you send exactly 100 USDC):

    ```json
    {
      "source": {
        "currency": "usdc",
        "amount": "100"
      },
      "destination": {
        "currency": "usdt"
      }
    }
    ```

    **Destination amount** (you receive exactly 100 USDT):

    ```json
    {
      "source": {
        "currency": "usdc"
      },
      "destination": {
        "currency": "usdt",
        "amount": "100"
      }
    }
    ```

    Provide amount in only one side - the system calculates the other based on the current rate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Exchange Rates">
    The `quoteInformation.rate` shows the exchange rate between currencies: - **1:1 stablecoins** (USDC ↔ USDT): Rate is typically "1" - **Market rates**: Rates may vary slightly based on liquidity Always verify `receiveNet` to see the exact amount you'll receive after any fees.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Billing Information">
    The `billingInformation.fees` array shows all applicable fees: **EXCHANGE_FEE**: Conversion fee for the swap - **timing: ON_INVOICE**: Billed on your monthly invoice (not deducted from swap) - **timing: ON_TRANSACTION**: Deducted from the swap amount **GAS_FEE**: Blockchain transaction fees (if applicable) Check `timing` to understand when fees are charged.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="External Wallet Swaps">
    Swap to external wallets (not managed by HIFI) by providing `externalWalletId` or `walletAddress`:

    ```json
    {
      "destination": {
        "chain": "POLYGON",
        "currency": "usdt",
        "walletAddress": "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb"
      }
    }
    ```

    Or use a registered external wallet:

    ```json
    {
      "destination": {
        "chain": "POLYGON",
        "currency": "usdt",
        "externalWalletId": "ext_xyz789"
      }
    }
    ```

    <Warning>
      External wallet swaps may require gas sponsorship enrollment. Use `userId` for HIFI wallets when possible.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Swap vs Bridge vs Transfer">
    Understanding the differences:

    **Swaps**: Exchange currencies on the same chain (USDC → USDT on Polygon)

    **Bridges**: Move same currency across chains (USDC on Polygon → USDC on Ethereum)

    **Transfers**: Move same currency to another wallet on same chain (USDC wallet A → USDC wallet B on Polygon)

## Sample Code

### Basic swap flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create swap">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/wallets/swaps" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "requestId": "1ab3e6e0-4839-4dbe-89c3-b06d9645ae86",
        "source": {
          "userId": "usr_abc123",
          "chain": "POLYGON",
          "currency": "usdc",
          "amount": "100"
        },
        "destination": {
          "userId": "usr_abc123",
          "chain": "POLYGON",
          "currency": "usdt"
        }
      }'
    ```

    The response will show status `PENDING`. Save the swap `id` from the response.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accept the swap">
    Accept the swap to execute the exchange: `bash curl -X POST
      "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/wallets/swaps/swp_abc123/accept" \ -H
      "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" ` The response will show status `COMPLETED` for successful swaps.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify completion">
    Check the swap details to confirm: - `status` - Should be `COMPLETED` - `destination.amount` - Amount received - `quoteInformation.rate` - Exchange rate used - `billingInformation.fees` - Any applicable fees
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle errors">
    If status is `FAILED`:

    - Check `error` field for error type
    - Review `errorDetails` for specific failure reason
    - Common issues: insufficient balance, unsupported pair, network congestion
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Swap with exact output amount

<Steps>
  <Step title="Specify destination amount">
    When you need to receive an exact amount:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/wallets/swaps" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "requestId": "1ab3e6e0-4839-4dbe-89c3-b06d9645ae86",
        "source": {
          "userId": "usr_abc123",
          "chain": "POLYGON",
          "currency": "usdc"
        },
        "destination": {
          "userId": "usr_abc123",
          "chain": "POLYGON",
          "currency": "usdt",
          "amount": "100"
        }
      }'
    ```

    The response will show status `PENDING`. Save the swap `id` from the response.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accept the swap">
    Accept the swap to execute: `bash curl -X POST
      "https://sandbox.hifibridge.com/v2/wallets/swaps/swp_abc123/accept" \ -H
      "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" `
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check source amount used">
    After acceptance, the response shows how much source currency was needed:

    - `source.amount` - Amount deducted from source wallet
    - `quoteInformation.sendNet` - Net amount sent after fees
  </Step>
